[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You only call me when it's all bad
I fall for you and I ain't call back
But my respect for you, I lost that
Baby, you're prettier in a mink
I hate when you're mean
You really think you're all that, baby, you really think you're all that
You really think you're all that, baby, you really think you're all that

[Verse]
This is my life and I cannot live it without you, I'm blindfolded
I know that you do just right what you want, but you was my side ho
I dogged you out in front of my friends, but you was my idol
I act like it's nothing, but I swear that pussy got me going psycho
I'm grabbing my— uh, yeah, yeah, on my tippy toes like Michael
I'm tryna fall from you like a pinecone
See, falling in love with you is something that I should've nеver did
She's so elеgant, she's an alien
Out of this world like Fifth Element
She got hella men
But she tell me that it is no better man
Then she ride me, she keep on just pedaling
Melatonin, her skin is like melanin
She give me head and she like Excedrin
Don't use wrappers, but I got them hella bands
Little mouse, but bank account 7'10"
Yeah, she know that I really got hella friends
With them Cubans, them shooters, them bales again

[Chorus]
You only call me when it's all bad
I fall for you and I ain't call back
But my respect for you, I lost that
Baby, you're prettier in a mink
I hate when you're mean
You really think you're all that, baby, you really think you're all that
You really think you're all that, baby, you really think you're all that

[Outro]
All that, baby, all that
You really think you're all that, baby, you're all that
You really think you're all that, baby, you really think you're all that
You really think you're all that, baby, you really think you're all that
