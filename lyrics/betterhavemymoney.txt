[Chorus]
Y'all better have my money
Y'all should know me well enough
Y'all better have my money
Please don't call me on my bluff
Y'all better have my money
Ballin' bigger than Lebron

Who ya'll think y'are fronting on
Like bau, bau, bau!

[Post Chorus]
Louis XIII and it's all on me
Boy you just bought a shot
Come and find me
If you think that you gon' knock me off the top
Shhh, your wife in the backseat of my brand new foreign car
Don't act like you forgot
I call the shot, shot, shots
Like bau, bau, bau

[Bridge]
Pay me what you owe me
Don't act like you forgot
Y'all better have my
Y'all better have my
Y'all better have my money
Y'all better have my
Y'all better have my
Y'all better have my money
Pay me what you owe
Better pay me
Better pay me what you owe me
Y'all better have my

[Verse]
Turn up to KC playing the whole club's getting crazy
Every time I drive by, I'm the only thing you're playin'
In a drop top, doin' hundred
Y'all in my rearview mirror racin'
We alive, we alive, we alive, we alive, we alive
Like bau, bau, bau!

[Post Chorus]
Louis XIII and it's all on me
Boy you just bought a shot
Come and find me
If you think that you gon' knock me off the top
Shhh, your wife in the backseat of my brand new foreign car
Don't act like you forgot
I call the shot, shot, shots
Like bau, bau, bau

[Outro]
Pay me what you owe me
Don't act like you forgot
Ohhhh, I call the shot, shot, shots
Y'all better have my
Y'all better have my money
Y'all better have my
Y'all better have my money
Better have my money, yeah
Better pay me what you owe me
Better pay me what you owe me
Y'all better have my
Y'all better have my
Y'all better have my
Y'all better have my money
