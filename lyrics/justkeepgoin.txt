Yo yo yo, you listening to tobi lou

This here is a Mococo pep talk okay
Twice as nice, twice as nice
You're gonna hear it straight from me

[Chorus]
I just wanna bop (I just wanna bop)
I just wanna bop that beat (bop)
Hop up in the Jeep (hop)
Put the lil' bitch in drive (vroom)
Fuck my 9 to 5
Disappear for weeks (gone)
Wash up on a beach (lost)
Might catch a lil' sunrise (catch it)
Caught me by surprise (I just wanna bop)

[Verse 1]
Waterfalls make me weak (no)
So I, so I creep (woah)
Mermaids on the reef (friends)
I want you for keeps
I don't wanna check my phone (no)
Ten percent my phone (ghost)
Let that b die slow
Message at the tone (tone)
See upcoming rap shows

[Chorus]
Twice as nice, twice as nice (What is this Kids Bop?)
I just wanna bop (I just wanna bop)

Caught me by surprise (I just wanna bop)

[Verse 2]
I just wanna cop some heat (No)

My new freak on fleek
I miss her to death and it's only been a week
Baby don't make me sing

[Chorus 2]
Twice as nice, twice as nice
Kids Bop headass
Can- can this be the las one?
Third time's a charm
You gotta come a little bit harder than that

[Verse 3]
Yeah, Jesus Christ superstar (superstar)

They give me wings and superpowers (yeah)
My bed look like "ooh la la" (ooh la la)
I need your love supersize (large)
I took off my suit and tie

I believe in things that you and I
But dreams gettin' crucified
I'm just happy you alive
Hey butterfly, you could fly
They chilling like a hookah lounge
I'm killin' shit, I'm super tired
Workin', workin', workin' overtime
Ion't even go outside (hey yeah)
Baby don't make me sing (sing)
I need a change of scene (scene)
I see the change in me (me)
Can't do complacency ('cy)
I'm tryna chase these dreams (dream)
Why they wanna wait for me (me)
Money gon' make me bleed (yeah)
Money gon' make me bleed (yeah)
Make my blood turn green (green)

Just keep going, just keep going
I know you going through things

Just keep going, just keep going

[Interlude]
I know you can do it
We all have days where we feel a bit off
But we just need to remind ourselves to take things in stride
And keep on at it, okay?
It's going to be okay because I believe in you! Hahaha :D

[Verse 4]
I just wanna bop (I just wanna bop)
Bop, hey

Got juice like box (got juice like box)
Got two on top (got two on top)
Got one in the chamber (yeah)
Takin' down the shot (take down the shot)
Do you love me or not? (do you love me or not?)
He sayin' that a lot (he sayin' that a lot)
It's like he really don't care (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Just don't ever change
I could really use some change
Might rob me a bank
'Cause I'm running out of paper

Oh you think you're a, Laker if you ever come back
Can you do me this favor

[Chorus]
I just wanna-
I just wanna bop that beat (bop)
Hop up in the Jeep (hop)
Put the lil' bitch in drive (vroom)
Fuck my 9 to 5
Disappear for weeks (gone)
Wash up on a beach (lost)
Might catch a lil' sunrise (catch it)
Caught me by surprise (I just wanna bop)
