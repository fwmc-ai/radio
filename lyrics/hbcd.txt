[Intro]
Shikanoko Nokonoko Koshitantan
Shikanoko Nokonoko Koshitantan
Shikanoko Nokonoko Koshitantan
Shikanoko Nokonoko Koshitantan

[Chorus: Bijou Koseki, Noko Shikanoko]
I been putting work in all week long
Now I'm turnt up tryna get me some
Hugs, Bunnies, Cookies and Deer
Shikanoko Nokonoko Koshitantan
Found out I'm not the only one
So I learned real quick and I moved right on to
Hugs, Bunnies, Cookies and Deer
Shikanoko Nokonoko Koshitantan

[Verse 1: Koseki Bijou, Noko Shikanoko]
Just one of those days
One of those weeks
First things first
Bathtub just leaked
40 million people watching my technique
At least I did my job, and my bathroom's clean

[Pre-Chorus 1: Koseki Bijou, Noko Shikanoko]
Late night movies and pranks
Hit the local church and I'm giving my thanks
Call up Calli, just had an epiphany
Let's go outside and do some activities

[Chorus: Bijou Koseki, Noko Shikanoko]
I been putting work in all week long
Now I'm turnt up tryna get me some
Hugs, Bunnies, Cookies and Deer
Shikanoko Nokonoko Koshitantan
Found out I'm not the only one
So I learned real quick and I moved right on to
Hugs, Bunnies, Cookies and Deer
Shikanoko Nokonoko Koshitantan

[Verse 2: Koseki Bijou, Noko Shikanoko]
Next thing I know, I feel like a chef
I got all my food groups, ain't no more left
Got my ten favourite snacks in the fridge
Boutta go fishing, might catch me a fish

[Pre-Chorus 2: Koseki Bijou, Noko Shikanoko]
Bedtime later than you, sippin' caffeine at a quarter-to-two
Is your favorite streamer Koseki Bijou?
Shout out to the Pebbles, yeah this song is for you

[Chorus: Bijou Koseki, Noko Shikanoko]
I been putting work in all week long
Now I'm turnt up tryna get me some
Hugs, Bunnies, Cookies and Deer
Shikanoko Nokonoko Koshitantan
Found out I'm not the only one
So I learned real quick and I moved right on to
Hugs, Bunnies, Cookies and Deer
Shikanoko Nokonoko Koshitantan

[Bridge: Koseki Bijou, Noko Shikanoko]
I said Macaroni
Mix it with my Colby Jack
I said Pepperoni
Ain't no one gonna hold me back
I wanna be your fave
Wanna show them that I'm able
H.B.C.D
That's the reason that I'm grateful
Macaroni
Macaroni

[Chorus: Bijou Koseki, Noko Shikanoko]
I been putting work in all week long
Now I'm turnt up tryna get me some
Hugs, Bunnies, Cookies and Deer
Shikanoko Nokonoko Koshitantan
Found out I'm not the only one
So I learned real quick and I moved right on to
Hugs, Bunnies, Cookies and Deer
Shikanoko Nokonoko Koshitantan
