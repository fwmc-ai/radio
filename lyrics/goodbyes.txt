[Verse 1: Gawr Gura, Nanashi Mumei, Amelia Watson, Ceres Fauna]
Me and Kurt feel the same, too much pleasure is pain
My girl spites me in vain, all I do is complain
She needs somethin' to change, need to take off the e-e-edge
Forget it all tonight
And don't tell me to shut up
When you know you talk too much
But you don't have things to say (Say)

[Chorus: Amelia Watson, Ceres Fauna. Gawr Gura, Nanashi Mumei]
I want you out of my head
I want you out of my bedroom tonight
There's no way I could save you
'Cause I need to be saved too
I'm no good at goodbyes

[Verse 2: Amelia Watson, Ceres Fauna. Gawr Gura, Nanashi Mumei]
We're both actin' insane, but too stubborn to change
Now I'm drinkin' again, 80 proof in my veins
And my fingertips stained, looking over the e-e-edge
Don't mess with me tonight
Say you needed this heart, then you got it
Turns out that it wasn't what you wanted
And we wouldn't let go and we lost it
Now I'm a goner

[Chorus: Ceres Fauna, Gawr Gura, Nanashi Mumei, Amelia Watson]
I want you out of my head
I want you out of my bedroom tonight
There's no way I could save you
'Cause I need to be saved too
I'm no good at goodbyes

[Verse 3: Ceres Fauna, Gawr Gura, Nanashi Mumei, Amelia Watson]
I want you out of my life
I want you back here tonight
I'm tryna cut you, no knife
I wanna slice you and dice you
My heart getd possessive, it got you precise
Can you not turn off the TV? I'm watchin' the fight
I flood the garage, blue diamond, no shark
You're Barbie life doll, it's Nicki Minaj
You don't need a key to drive, your car on the charger
I just wanna see the side, the one that's unbothered (Yeah)
And I don't want ya to never go outside (Outside)
I promise if they play, my little slidin' (Slidin')
I'm lovin' her, and the tour bus still ridin' (Ridin')
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Gawr Gura, Nanashi Mumei, Amelia Watson, Ceres Fauna]
I want you out of my head (Head)
I want you out of my bedroom tonight (Bedroom)
There's no way I could save you (Save you)
'Cause I need to be saved too (Saved too)
I'm no good at goodbyes
[Outro: Post Malone & Young Thug]
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye (Bye, bye)
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye (Bye, bye)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye (Bye, bye, bye)
I'm no good at goodbyes
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye (Bye, bye)
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye (Bye, bye)
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye (Bye, bye)
I'm no good at goodbyes
