[Verse 1: Mococo Abyssgard]
Bouncing
You don’t get this high
Without some ounces
Fountain
Bitch I’m sippin lean
Right out the fountain
Pouncing like a Demon
Dog, I been around bitch
Counting, Ruffian donations
Got this hound rich
I’m sitting in first class, bau
Getting these headpats now
I’m not the type to back down
Spend a stack, pass it around
If I eat, the team eat too
Fluffy, fuzzy, it’s a mood
Bau bau been a way of life
Stay them dogs, we canines

[Bridge: Mococo Abyssgard, Koseki Bijou, Shiori Novella, Nerissa Ravencroft]
Go Fuwawa
Bau bau bau bau
Go Fuwawa
Bau bau bau bau
Go Fuwawa
Bau bau bau bau
Go Fuwawa
Bau bau bau bau

[Verse 2: Fuwawa Abyssgard]
Catch me in the backseat
Quick with it, max speed
2 dogs vs you chickens
What is this? a Zaxby’s?
~ “Ma’am this is a Wendy’s” ~
Even better, I got beef
Let’s square up
Get our squabble on
Blood between the cracks
Leave they bodies on the cobblestone
Blue tone oshi
With the motion that’s a fact
I been gettin’ real cozy
While running up a bag
Click clack, pull it back
Bau bau & that’s that
Yeah we taking care of business
Demon dogs leading the pack

Go Koseki
Go go Koseki
Go Koseki Go go Koseki
Go Koseki
Go go Koseki
Go Koseki
Go go Koseki

[Verse 3: Koseki Bijou]
A, I, A, I
Bitch I’m feeling Skibidi
*BIBOO WIPER LAUGH*
Windows clean
My aura shining
Elden on my pinky
Gemstones ‘round the ring
Got a dark soul
They call me emo, think that I’m scene
Mask on, no reveal, this is not a dream
Take aim, this rock done brought out the beam
(Biboo, Biboo BEEEAAAAAM)
Katana slice deep, 8-1-8-0-0
They could never keep me caged 
Paint me a villain, I’ll play the hero

[Bridge: Mococo Abyssgard, Fuwawa Abyssgard, Koseki Bijou, Nerissa Ravencroft]
Shiori, Shi-Shiori
Shiori, Shi-Shiori
Shiori, Shi-Shiori
Shiori, Shi-Shiori

[Verse 4: Shiori Novella]
I pick up the pen and write
About my life, about my highs
About my lows, about the times
I stood in fear, my body froze
This novel long, I’m flipping pages
Scared to see the end
There’s that word, graduation
I just lost another friend
Anxiety and doubt
Lurk like ghosts in my house
Get the most out of life
When I push past my bounds
If you unbind the pages
Does the story stay the same?
Let’s find out together
I’m Shiori, what’s your name?

[Bridge: Mococo Abyssgard, Fuwawa Abyssgard, Koseki Bijou, Shiori Novella]
Go Rissa, Nerissa
Go Rissa, Nerissa
Go Rissa, Nerissa
Go Rissa, Nerissa

[Verse 5: Nerissa Ravencroft]
I live this life as my payment
I’m taking flight with the ravens
I’m breaking bars off of cages
All of my jailbirds worth saving
I’m that devilish diva
Stick to my side, like I’m Mita
Yeah I’m the demon of sound
That’s how I come with the heaters
And if you ever need me
You can hit my receiver
You know I’m always near
And I will book it like readers
I got irrational fears
That lead to actual tears
But I’ve made memories with Advent
That will last through the years 

[Outro: Mococo Abyssgard, Fuwawa Abyssgard, Koseki Bijou, Shiori Novella, Nerissa Ravencroft]
Go Advent
Go Advent, Go!
Go Advent
Go Advent, Go!
Go Advent
Go Advent, Go!
Go Advent
Go Advent, Go!
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Bau bau
Bau bauncin, bauncin
Bau bau
Bau bauncin, bauncin
