[Chorus]
FREE GURA
I just got a pardon from the chief
FREE GURA
Blue like the presidents on me
GURA
I could still rob you
I could still rob you
Back from the dead
They been calling me a
ZOMBIE

[Verse 1]
Red in the water
Like chumbud blood
Talk a lot of drama
No radio plays
Suspense in the air like
Dun dun dun
Looking for the Fin
When I’m MIA
You can’t put an end to me though
Y’all steady trippin’ like acid no amino
Ever seen a shark with a Desert Eagle?
I get em shaking like a tambourine show
I could go band4band with Cee
No South Central, what’s this red on me?
Sometimes I forget the meals I eat
Til I’m looking at they bones, while I’m ppicking my teeth

[Chorus]
FREE GURA
I just got a pardon from the chief
FREE GURA
Blue like the presidents on me
GURA
I could still rob you
I could still rob you
Back from the dead
They been calling me a
ZOMBIE

[Verse 2]
Made my home in the trenches of course
Me and Mariana got a thousand corpses
Sinister urge to purge submerged
Locked on my target, I’m clipping the nerves
Deeper we sinking
The thinking has stopped
It’s fight, it’s flight
It’s win, it’s loss
It’s me, the boss
I’m working through action
You on defense
I’m steady attacking
Make up your mind
Who is you backing
Hololive
I’m the main attraction
Take away me
And you making a fraction
Bars all me, lil poetry
Snappin’
Yeah, my Jaws reactive
Prone to spasms
Bouta get cast
By Steve, lil bitch
Free Gura, Free Gura 
Free me lil bitch
Got no competition
GG lil bitch
Got my justice
Got my justice
Rolling with the squad
Supercell, you look BUSTED
Rolling with the squad
It’s the Myths I trusted
Rolling with the squad
#FREEGURA we up

[Chorus]
FREE GURA
I just got a pardon from the chief
FREE GURA
Blue like the presidents on me
GURA
I could still rob you
I could still rob you
Back from the dead
They been calling me a
ZOMBIE
