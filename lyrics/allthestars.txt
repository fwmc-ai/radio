[Intro: FUWAMOCO]
Have fun at work sweetie
I'll miss you
I love you
Have fun at work sweetie
I'll miss you
I wuv you

[Pre-Chorus: Shiori Novella, FUWAMOCO]
Love, let's talk about love
Is it everything and anything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you?
I know the feeling haunt you

[Chorus: FUWAMOCO, Shiori Novella]
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer

[Verse 1: FUWAMOCO, Shiori Novella]
Tell me what you gon' do to me (Do to me)
Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me (New to me)
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
But you can't bring the truth to me (Truth to me)
You and all your expectations
I don't even want your congratulations
I recognize your false confidence and calculated promises
All in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy 'cause I didn't invite you
Oh, you important? You the moral to the story? You endorsin'?
Motha, I don't even like you (I don't even like you)
Corrupt a man's heart with a gift (With a gift)
A small percentage who I'm buildin' with (Buildin' with)
That's how you find out who you dealin' with (Dealin' with)
I want the credit if I'm losin' or I'm winnin'
On my mother, that's the realest, it's all

[Pre-Chorus: Shiori Novella, FUWAMOCO]
Love, let's talk about love
Is it everything and anything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you?
I know the feeling haunt you

[Chorus: FUWAMOCO, Shiori Novella]
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer

[Verse 2: Shiori Novella, FUWAMOCO]
Skin covered in ego
Get to talkin' like ya involved
Like a rebound, no control
No off switch in the way that you bringin' me down
It's a turn on, get it away from me
Know you mean wrong, keep away from me
And it's all wrong, get it away from me, yeah, yeah
I just cry for no reason
I just pray for no reason
I just thank for the life, for the day
For the hours and another life breathin'
How did it all go to feel good?
You'd leave it all if it feel bad
Better live your life
We been runnin' out of time

[Pre-Chorus: Shiori Novella, FUWAMOCO]
Love, let's talk about love
Is it everything and anything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you?
I know the feeling haunt you

[Chorus: FUWAMOCO, Shiori Novella]
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer

[Outro]
I wuv you
