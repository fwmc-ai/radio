[Intro: Kai Cenat]
(Ayy, Draco)
I wanna get something off my chest real quick
I see the majority of people hating on Ironmouse
for breaking the record...
I'm not gonna lie
Ironmouse has always been Top 5 of all time

[Chorus: Kai Cenat & Ironmouse]
Bustdown Rollie, avalanche
Yeah, my old bitch average
This my first time rappin' and
I might go retarded, shit
Bentley coupe, I'm dashin' it
Stand on my money, I'm tall as shit
Told 'em, "Don't you doubt the kid"
Told 'em, "Don't you doubt the kid"
Bustdown Rollie, avalanche
Yeah, my old bitch average
This my first time rappin' it
I might go retarded, shit
Bentley coupe, I'm dashin' it
Stand on my money, I'm tall as shit
Told you, "Don't you doubt the kid"
Told 'em, "Don't you doubt the kid"

[Verse 1: Kai Cenat]
I ran up thirty on thirty on thirty
When I'm in the streets, I stay too sturdy
Two by two Hellcat, go fast
Four by four, Lamb' truck on the gas
I'm only eighteen with big dreams
Before eighteen, I seen things
Feelin' like a big boss with six rings
Or a bumblebee with six stings
Tired of "Bustdown Avalanche"?
Remind y'all what my status is
Chain on froze like a mannequin
My prime, I ain't passed that shit
The surface, I'm just scratchin' it
AMG, just copped the whip
The surface, I'm just scratchin' it
AMG, just copped the whip (Mm-hmm)
This one of my gifts, I'm sharin' it
Had to learn how to carry it
Confidence, the scariest (Mm-hmm)
Sicker than a variant
Lead these niggas like Harriet
These bitches be so arrogant
Go to the room, get the gun
After that, I'm clearin' it (Brrt)

[Verse 2: Ironmouse]
Ayy, ayy
Don’t you doubt the kid
Breaking records, clownin’ them
Ironmouse and Kai Cenat
We on top, are you down with that?
I get the money, I’m trapping for cheddar
I’m getting better & better & better
Are you a dummy? Then go with the beat
I rep the Shojo with a V
I might freestyle, AMP
I might flood out my stream
I might raise a milly just to donate it
All to charity
I could flash my pussy
My gender still not believed
They insecure, I’m cute as fuck
So they stay hating on me

Bust down baby, Mouse-iana
Avalanche, go cold on yah
I will never fold baby
'Less we talkin’ paper bands
PR - so I 'stunt' on 'em
Pull a lil gun on 'em
Watch em shake and shiver
That’s a sight that I’ll be savoring

[Chorus: Kai Cenat & Ironmouse]
Bustdown Rollie, avalanche
Yeah, my old bitch average
This my first time rappin' and
I might go retarded, shit
Bentley coupe, I'm dashin' it
Stand on my money, I'm tall as shit
Told 'em, "Don't you doubt the kid"
Told 'em, "Don't you doubt the kid"
Bustdown Rollie, avalanche
Yeah, my old bitch average
This my first time rappin' it
I might go retarded, shit
Bentley coupe, I'm dashin' it
Stand on my money, I'm tall as shit
Told you, "Don't you doubt the kid"
Told 'em, "Don't you doubt the kid"
