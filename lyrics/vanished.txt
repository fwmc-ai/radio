[Verse 1]
In the dark lights, we come out and play
We are its children and we're here to stay
Running through the streets, hungry for strays
No invita-ta-take me away
I'm not cruel, but that's still what you see
Club to club, come on the city with me
Hungry for life without your pity
I don't want -- but you give it

[Chorus]
You still can't say she won't start up
You still can't say she won't start up a fight
You go the city
'Cause in the city of life she can't, she can't wait

[Verse 2]
In the darkness, a killer awaits
To kill a life and the life you make
You do another so this death can live
Just keep on dancing to the movie you're in
The smell of your sweat just lures me in
Your heartbeat does things to me
Running feet beats through my blood
My ghost inside you soon will be

[Chorus]
Still can't say she won't start up
Still can't say she won't start up a fight
You go city
'Cause in the city of life she can't, she can't wait

[Bridge]
Hungry for strays, hungry for life, no invitat— your pity
Hungry for strays, hungry for life, no invitat— your pity
Hungry for strays, hungry for life, no invitat— your pity
Hungry for strays, hungry for life, no invitat— your pity
Hungry for strays, hungry for life, no invitat— your pity
Hungry for strays, hungry for life, no invitat— your pity
Hungry for strays, hungry for life, no invitat— your pity
Hungry for strays, hungry for life, no invitat— your pity

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want sex, but you give it t—

[Chorus]
Still can't say she won't start up
Still can't say she won't start up a fight
You go city
'Cause in the city of life she can't, she can't wait
Still can't say she won't start up
Still can't say she won't start up a fight
You go city
'Cause in the city of life she can't, she can't wait

[Outro]
Now it's over, you've taken your life
Dark grows thin and left to hide
I don't regret it, but it's sad anyway
Now we're both dead and so scared of the black
This life of games and diligent trust
It's the things we do and the things we must
I'm now tired of being cussed
So go sleep forever end to dust
