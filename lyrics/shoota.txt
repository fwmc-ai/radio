[Intro: Gawr Gura]
Now
Now is my time
Now is my time
Oh senpai, hey...
I didn't know you walked this way ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ

[Verse 1: Gawr Gura, FUWAMOCO]
Everybody rock with me because I'm up now
Took your girl and I'ma score like I made the touchdown
Swervin' in that Lambo', doors go up, not on a bus now
Used to want a G-Shock, now I'm walking with a bustdown
Pull up and I'm flooded with a iced-out watch
Whip, it look like butter, baby, pecan drop
Pecan drop, put that four in Sun Drop
Stack my knots, count a lot, saw a lot
Got them rocks, diamond rocks, whip the pot
Suicide, 1600, that's the block
Hit your girl, that's check-free
She ain't used to text me
Now she wanna caress me
She keep tryna neck me
I gotta tell my bestie
Someone call my bestie
Think I found my bestie
Link up, make a check bleed
You know that I'm smokin' dope
I'll be high 'til next week
Know I had to let her go
'Cause she can't arrest me

[Chorus: FUWAMOCO]
Uh, woke up with my toolie, what it do? Bau, bau
Meet me in the alley with the troops, uh
I got red shooters, I got blue, bau, bau
Let that thing down and point at you, huh, uh
Bentley or the 'Rari, ho, let's choose, bau, bau
We gon' rob the bank, bring the loot, uh, uh
We gon' take these boys back to school, bau, bau
Money on the floor just like some shoes

[Verse 2: Gawr Gura, FUWAMOCO]
Stackin', rackin', all hundreds I'm packin'
My life, it is like a movie minus all the actin'
Jacket, jacket, yeah, it's made of rabbit
Diamonds on my neck and wrist, they compliment the carats
You ain't nothin' but a mockingbird, boy, you a parrot
Oops, yeah, my bad, that's your girl? We can share it
Might buy her diamonds and pearls but can't marry
She, said my D bomb like a terrorist
He, think he on but, man, that's barely
We, rock all white ice, look like dairy
Keys, my red Hellcat, it sound scary
Please, you talk shit and you get buried
See, ain't no fuck dogs around me
I said free my dogs from the county, free my dogs
The ones on the run from the bounty, yeah
Diamonds, they so wet, need some Bounty

[Chorus: FUWAMOCO]
Uh, woke up with my toolie, what it do? Bau, bau
Meet me in the alley with the troops, uh
I got red shooters, I got blue, bau, bau
Let that thing down and point at you, huh, uh
Bentley or the 'Rari, ho, let's choose, bau, bau
We gon' rob the bank, bring the loot, uh, uh
We gon' take these boys back to school, bau, bau
Money on the floor just like some shoes

[Verse 3: FUWAMOCO, Gawr Gura]
Uh, money on the floor just like some shoes, yeah
I'ma fuck your thot, she just a swoop, hah, yeah
I'ma fuck your thot, she just a swoop, hah, yeah
And I love my goons, yeah
And I love my tool (Yeah), yeah (Yeah)
And I love my loot (What?), yeah
Fuck with me and you gon' lose (What?)
Don't talk to me, just talk to my lil' dude
Don't talk to me, just talk to my lil' dude

[Chorus: FUWAMOCO]
Uh, woke up with my toolie, what it do? Bau, bau
Meet me in the alley with the troops, uh
I got red shooters, I got blue, bau, bau
Let that thing down and point at you, huh, uh
Bentley or the 'Rari, ho, let's choose, bau, bau
We gon' rob the bank, bring the loot, uh, uh
We gon' take these boys back to school, bau, bau
Money on the floor just like some shoes

[Outro: Gawr Gura, FUWAMOCO]
Everybody rock with me because I'm up now
Bau bau!
