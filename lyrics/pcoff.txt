[Intro]
All we ever wanted, pink & blue grand national
Fluff being rational 
Give em what they ask for (bau, bau, bau!)

[Chorus]
It’s not enough
Hit a milli last month
But it’s not enough
Spared you in Round 1
But it’s not enough
Say you bigger than us?
But it’s not enough

Getting headpats
Yeah somebody’s gotta do it
Go & check the stats
Yeah somebody’s gotta do it
Make Ruffians laugh
Yeah somebody’s gotta do it
Huh, we survived outside
these two dogs do it like
Bau, Bau, Bau!

[Verse 1]
They like “oh my god”
It’s the alpha and omega, it’s the demon dogs
Bau, Bau, Bau!
This is not a song  
This a revelation, how to get ‘em, get ‘em gone
Need a waifu baby, I don’t understand baby
See you smile and make you feel protected like I can, baby
Teach you something if you need correction, that’s the plan baby
Don’t put your life in nobody else’s hands, baby 
Bau, Bau, Bau!

[Chorus]
It’s not enough
Hit a milli last month
But it’s not enough
Spared you in Round 1
But it’s not enough
Say you bigger than us?
But it’s not enough

Getting headpats
Yeah somebody’s gotta do it
Go & check the stats
Yeah somebody’s gotta do it
Make  Ruffians laugh
Yeah somebody’s gotta do it
Huh, we survived outside
these two dogs do it like
Bau, Bau, Bau!

[Verse 2]
Hey, turn they PC off
Ain’t fluffin' with VT’s? Then don’t you get involved
Hey, what, huh, how many should I send? Send ‘em all
Take a risk or take a trip, you know I’m trippin’ for my dog
Who you with? Advent, know we bout to set it off
Ever since breaking free, been evadin’ getting caught
Fluffy and fuzzy, we up, yeah I meant that
Hey, back out if they act out, yeah, I did that

Hey what’s up though?
I hate a bitch that’s hating on a bitch and they both hoes
I hate a dog hating on some dogs and they both broke
If you ain’t coming for the bau bau what you come for?

Always had our eyes set on being big idols
Went from Can to Japan, talkin’ 5k miles
Went and did it our way, spin it, two twins style
Bitch it’s bau bau bau all the way, all the while 

[Chorus]
It’s not enough
Hit a milli last month
But it’s not enough
Spared you in Round 1
But it’s not enough
Say you bigger than us?
But it’s not enough

[Chorus 2]
BAU BAUUUUUUUUU
Getting headpats
Yeah somebody’s gotta do it
Go & check the stats
Yeah somebody’s gotta do it
Turn they stream off, Turn they stream off
Turn they stream off, Turn they stream off
Turn they stream off, Turn they stream off
Turn they stream off, Turn they stream off

[Verse 3]
Ain’t no other queens in this rap thing, we siblings
Nothing but my kouhai, one shot, they disappearing
Two demon dogs is exactly what they fearing
Steering that ambulance, bau bau
Here it is, two kids grown up
Thought all was lost, but then Yagoo showed up
Whipping round in the ride like it was a loaner
Don’t talk down to my lil sis
Don’t put Moco in the corner, no
Perfect storm, try to chase us down
All these copycat streamers look basic now
We’re so thankful for the friends we found
Cuz you know it’s sold out when we hit your town

[Bridge]
Everybody to the left go bau bau now
Everybody to the right go bau bau now
Everybody in sight go bau bau now
Go bau bau now, go bau bau now

[Chorus 2 - Outro]
BAU BAUUUUUUUU
Getting headpats
Yeah somebody’s gotta do it
Go & check the stats
Yeah somebody’s gotta do it
Turn they stream off, Turn they stream off
Turn they stream off, Turn they stream off
Turn they stream off, Turn they stream off
Turn they stream off, Turn they stream off
