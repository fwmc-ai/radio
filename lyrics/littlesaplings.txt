[Verse 1]
Oh little saplings,
Won't you grow
Oh won't you grow
Without me
Oh little saplings,
Won't you go,
Oh won't you go on
Without me

[Chorus]
'Cause I'll still be there
At your roots
And I'll still be there
For you
Oh little saplings
Oh little saplings
It's time to grow, it's time to go
My little saplings

[Verse 2]
Seasons change, and branches bend
The forest whispers of an ending and a start
Every leaf that falls, every seed that flies
Carries a piece of me, carries my heart

[Bridge]
I am not leaving, I am letting go
Roots run deeper than the paths we know
Your strength is not in holding, but in letting be
In growing wild and free, in finding your own melody

[Alt Chorus]
Oh little saplings,
Watch me go
See how I grow
Beyond these trees
Oh little saplings,
Know that home
Is not a place
But memories

[Outro]
Cuz I'll still be there
At your roots
And I'll still be there
For you
My little saplings
My little saplings
Oh little saplings
Always growing
Always whole
It's time to grow, it's time to go
My little sapling
