A silly fella,
She sang like she was breathing
Wherever’s alright
Music has all the meaning
Only singing, keeps her heart beating
Walking down the, only path that she knew

It’s not easy, failing completely
When I was tired someone stopped and said to me
You’re a singing star, you’re a singing star
But I see no star
Many years have gone by

(We still) Sky high sky fly sky dope
(We still) Same try same scar same work
(We still) Wherever in the world
(We still) Working in hotel rooms

(I still) Do so well one day and fail the very next day
(I still) Who should I be today? Katherine or S. Rain?
Twenty three now but still at lost how to live my life
So today we just gonna go with the flow

We going from New York to Cali
London to Paris
Wherever we go doesn’t matter it’s a party
El Mariachi, El Mariachi, El Mariachi

We going from Tokyo, Italy
Hong Kong to Brazil
I will sing anywhere my feet decides to take me
El Mariachi, El Mariachi, El Mariachi, El Mariachi

Everyday I’m floating, everyday I’m floating eh uh
Everyday I’m feeling, everyday I’m checking in uh
Everyday I’m flying with the clouds yeah all day eh
Everyday I’m riding in the air and fade in
You don't know maybe

I’ve been flying a thousand miles
Been walking down airplane aisles
If you want it come and get it sorry that you didn't make it
I’ll give you all my points
Love airplane mode, turn my worries off
Chillin dozin' off
Doesn’t matter what they say I’m gonna be swagging
Flying on the starry horizon

(I dunno I dunno I dunno I dunno)
Don’t know how to stop now
(I dunno I dunno I dunno I dunno)
Don’t know how to breathe now
(I dunno I dunno I dunno I dunno)
Don’t know how to fall now
(I dunno I dunno I dunno I dunno)

Flaunting all your dough knowing it’s for show
Cute of you but I’m fed up
You got all that from the media
I’m busy flipping my passport
Checking in all the time

Go go go go yeah yeah
You’re great at playing celebrites
Oh well too bad we’re still the same (woah!)

We going from Mexico City
London to Paris
Wherever we go doesn’t matter it’s a party
El Mariachi, El Mariachi, El Mariachi

We going from Tokyo Italy
Hong Kong to Brazil
I will sing anywhere my feet decides to take me
El Mariachi, El Mariachi, El Mariachi, El Mariachi
(oooh....)
