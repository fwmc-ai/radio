[Intro: Kiara Takanashi, FUWAMOCO]
Okay so once you got accepted
Where were you and what was your reaction
When you got the final approval to join Holo?
So what about FUWAMOCO?
For us well
When we got the e-mail being like
"I would like to talk to you"
We were really, really, really happy
And we were jumping up and down
Jumping up and down and really, really happy
Yes, right? Yeah
And then 30 minutes later we were like:
"What if they were lying?"

[Chorus: FUWAMOCO]
I am no Chihuahua 
I’m Fuwawa, bau bau
I am not Fuwawa
I’m Mococo, bau bau
From the streets to The Holo
Bau bau bau bau
Went from the streets to The Holo
Bau bau bau bau

[Verse 1: FUWAMOCO]
Chilling out in Tokyo
Mococo get a poki bowl
Fuwawa spent a whole band
All these pooches thirsty
Got em drinkin’ out my water bowl
And we got em, and we got emfloored
Like we taught em how to roll
That’s a Good boy, sit
Good boy, sit

On my hood boy shit
On My hood boy shit

[Chorus: FUWAMOCO]
I am no Chihuahua 
I’m Fuwawa, bau bau

From the streets to The Holo
Bau bau bau bau

Bau bau bau bau

[Verse 2: FUWAMOCO]
I don’t miss
When I’m rollin’ with my sis
Paws got claws
How I’m guardian the abyss, yeah

When I’m rollin’ with my sis
Protect your smile
All the while, hitting licks
MOCO-CHAN?!
No like hitting 'licks', you get it?? *Lick*
Hit a lick
Yeah, bitch I hit a lick
All these other bitches that you been with got ticks
& Fleas, please, you smell like wet dog
And you look like Frank the Pug from MIB
Ugly ass it's bau bau if I see you in the street
Me with a 9 is what they call a pup 'n' heat
I could be your dog
Or I could turn into a demon
FUWAMOCO in the Morning with a warning
Yeah, yeah, listen up Ruffians
Cuz it’s Bau Bau Season

[Bridge: FUWAMOCO]
We the Demon Dogs
Dressed in blue
Dressed in pink
Yeah we the Demon Dogs

[Chorus: FUWAMOCO]
I am no Chihuahua 
I’m Fuwawa, bau bau
I am not Fuwawa
I’m Mococo, bau bau
From the streets to The Holo
Bau bau bau bau
Went from the streets to The Holo
Bau bau bau bau
