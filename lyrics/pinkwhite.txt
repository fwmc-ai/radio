[Intro]
Bau bau
Moco-chan wants to order a pink sofa
I want a pink one // and I don't know
It's tiny
I want a pink one!
I would like to be able to sit on the sofa with Moco-chan
at least one senpai // This is not what the hashtag was made for
I would like a senpai to sit on the sofa too // It's not!
It's not what the hashtag was made for / Nooo!
heh heh heh heh heh

[Verse 1]
That's the way every day goes
Every time we've got no control
If the sky is pink and white
If the ground is black and yellow
It's the same way you showed me
Nod my head, don't close my eyes
Halfway on a slow move
It's the same way you showed me
If you could fly, then you'd feel south
Up north's getting cold soon
The way it is, we're on dry land
Still, I'm someone to hold true
Keep you cool when it's still alive
Won't let you down when it's all ruin

[Chorus]
Just the same way you showed me
Showed mе
And you showed me love
And thе glory from above
Regard, my dear
It's all downhill from here

[Verse 2]
In the wake of a hurricane
Dark skin of a summer shade
Nosedive into flood lines
Tall tower of milk crates
It's the same way you showed me, yeah
Cannonball off the porch side
Older kids trying off the roof
Just the same way you showed me
If you could die and come back to life
Up for air from the swimming pool
You'd kneel down to the dry land
Kiss the earth that birthed you
Gave you tools just to stay alive
And make it out when the sun is ruined

[Chorus]
Just the same way you showed me
Showed me
You showed me love
And the glory from above
Regard, my dear, my dear, my dear
'Cause it's all downhill from here

[Bridge]
Remember life, yeah, remember how it was
We would climb trees
Michael Jackson, it all ends here
You can say what up to Matthew
Say what up to to Shoob
Say what up to Danny
Say what up to life immortality
Bending up my Nikes
Running out of Melpomene, nicotine
Stealing granny cigarettes
Take it easy, baby
Give me somethin' sweet, sweet
Bitch, I might like
Bitch, I might like
I might like immortality
This is life, life immortality
[Outro]
That's the way every day goes
Every time we've no control
If the sky is pink and white
If the ground is black and yellow
It's the same way you showed me
Showed me
