[Intro: Gawr Gura]
So tight, so fly
You got me lifted, you got me lifted

[Chorus: Gawr Gura, Senzawa]
You got me lifted, shifted, higher than a ceiling
And ooh-wee, it's the ultimate feeling
You got me lifted, feeling so gifted
Sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?

[Verse 1: Gawr Gura]
You know it's leather when we ride
We're flinging rawhide
Doing what we do, watching screens getting high
Gurl you keep it so fly with your sweet hunnybuns
You was there when the money gone
You'll be there when the money comes
Off top I can't lie, I love to get blowed
You my lil' sugar, I'm yo little chulo
And every time we kick it, it's off to the groovy
Treat you like my sticky ickey or my sweet oowy goowy (For real though)

[Chorus: Gawr Gura, Senzawa]
You got me lifted, shifted, higher than a ceiling
And ooh-wee, it's the ultimate feeling
You got me lifted, feeling so gifted
Sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?

[Verse 2: Senzawa]
Now I ain't worried about a thing 'cause I just hit me a lick
I got a fat sack and a superfly chick
There ain't nothing you can say to a playa
Cause doowop, she fly like the planes in the air
That's right she's full grown, setting the wrong tone
I'm digging the energy and I'm loving the o-zone
So fly like a dove, so fly like a raven
Quick to politic with some fly conversation
In a natural mood, then I'm a natural dude
And we some natural fools blowing out by the pool
She like my sexy-cool mama with blades on her berata
Rockin' Dolce Gabbana with highdrows and a Cubana

[Chorus: Gawr Gura, Senzawa]
You got me lifted, shifted, higher than a ceiling
And ooh-wee, it's the ultimate feeling
You got me lifted, feeling so gifted
Sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?

[Verse 3: Gawr Gura]
Ah, she got cherry lips, angel eyes
She knows exactly how to tantalize
She's out to get you, danger by design
Cold-blooded vixen, she don't compromise
She's somethin' mystical in colored lights
I say, so far from typical, but take my advice
Before you play with fire, do think twice
And if you get burned, well, baby, don't you be surprised
For real though

[Chorus: Gawr Gura, Senzawa]
You got me lifted, shifted, higher than a ceiling
And ooh-wee, it's the ultimate feeling
You got me lifted, feeling so gifted
Sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?

[Verse 4: Gawr Gura]
Oh, Sweet-talkin' lady, love how you entice
Sugar with just the right amount of spice
Charmin', allurin', everyone's desire
She's out to get you â€“ you can't run, you can't hide (So high like I'm a star)
She's somethin' mystical in colored lights (So high like I'm a star)
So far from typical, but take my advice (So high like I'm a star)
Before you play with fire, do think twice (So high like I'm a star)
And if you get burned, don't be surprised

[Outro: Gawr Gura]
Cuz you got me lifted
You got me shifted
You got me lifted
Higher than the ceiling
You got me lifted
You got me shifted
Cuz you got me lifted
Higher than the ceiling, baby
