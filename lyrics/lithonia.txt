[Chorus: Filian]
Cody LaRae
He had a break
He's findin' out
That nobody gives a fuck
I did my job
I paid my dues
Love is for fools
'Cause nobody gives a fuck

[Post-Chorus: Filian]
No one, no one
No oneâ€”
Nobody gives a fuck

[Verse: Filian]
I feel liberated
Over medicated
It was overrated
Damn, what you want?
I can tell by the look on your face (Oh)
Let me outta here (Oh)
I've been gone so long
Don't you know that
This is the moment?
You're watching us throw it away

[Chorus: Filian]
Cody LaRae (Cody LaRae)
He had a break (He had a break)
He's findin' out
That nobody gives a fuck (Oh)
I did my job (I did my job)
I paid my dues (I paid my dues)
Love is for fools
'Cause nobody gives a fuck

[Post-Chorus: Filian]
No one, no one
Nobody gives a fuck

[Bridge: Filian, Elizabeth Rose Bloodflame]
My sweet Lithonia
What have you done?
These are your children
I am your son

[Chorus: Filian, Elizabeth Rose Bloodflame]
Cody LaRae (Cody LaRae)
What have you done? (He had a break)
(He's findin' out)
Nobody gives a fuck
Cody LaRae (Cody LaRae)
What have you done? (I paid my dues)
(Love is for fools)
Nobody gives a fuck

[Outro: Filian]
Cody LaRae
He had a break
He's findin' out
Nobody gives a fuck
