[Verse 1: Burnice White]
Burn shit
I scorch it
Add fuel, Nitro,
Hoard it
I know what’s important
Gas in my tank
Got the engine roaring
All is going to the plan according
Violence rain
My flames get pouring
And I got the mocktails, mixers, ice
Wind through my hair as I rev my bike
Aye what the hell, just one more fight
Hollow in sight see me ride right in
Not ninetails but the fire spin
Activate my W Engine
Charrin’ Ethereals
Caught ‘em slippin
Get passionate when I handle my business

[Verse 2: Ellen Joe]
Joe, Joe,
Mama beena maid bitch
Sugar in my system
I’m not sippin’ lemonade, bitch
Hit ‘em with the dusta
Then we wiping off the prints
Blood in the water
Guess this shark got some sense
Pop, pop, pop
Like the candy in my jaw
Teeth sharp like Corin saw
Housekeeping call
Run a sweep through the hall
Dashin’ for the cash
Stack it up tall
Then I go and drop a bag
At the Lumina Mall
Friends all around me
Circle like a shark
Raiders going down
Like I sunk the Lost Ark
You only ever heard my bark
Never felt the bite
Cleaning up the scene
It’s Victoria for life

[Verse 3: Nicole Demara]
Why pay today
What I can loan out til tomorrow
That’s the Nicole way
Last name: Demara
Tryna find some Dennies
Taking Interknot comishies
Cunning like a hare
And yes, it’s soft and squishy
Dyed pink, what did you think?
I was a natural, well I am
If you’re talking about
Finding ways to scheme and run a scam
Ask Anne I be the GOAT
Or Billy’s not a Starlight Knight fan
Let me keep this case brief
I’ve got the cannon in my hand
Blasting any motherfucker
Who stand up to me
A black hole couldn’t come between
Me and my money
Get corrupted in the streets
See the ether doing damage
My finances going up
Now that’s something I can manage

ZZZ, Cypher
ZZZ, Cypher
ZZZ, Cypher
ZZZ, Cypher
(That's the Nicole way
Last Name: Demara)

Done
As much as I love this weapon
Maintaining it is a pain
