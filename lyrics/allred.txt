[Chorus]
Upside-down cross tat' on my neck, shut 'em up, uh, uh
Upside-down cross tat' on my neck, shut 'em up
Upside-down cross tat' on my neck, shut 'em up, uh, uh
Upside-down cross tat' on my neck, shut 'em up, uh
The Bentley's parked outside
My vibe tryna go for a ride
I put VETEMENTS right on her thighs
I put the mask on 'cause I be fried
All red, I stay with the Fives
All red, we pull up and fire
All red, somebody dyin'
All red, I pour up then drive

[Verse]
We done pushed up with the SIGs
Just like Madden, you can get blitzed
I used to rock badges, then I got rich
This is a thot, she can't be my bitch, shyea shyea
This is a thot, she can't be my bitch, shyea shyea
I come to your spot, we spray out that bitch, shyea shyea
I come to your spot, we spray out that bitch, shyea shyea
I come to your spot and I take that shit, hol' up, uh
I got the drop, we layin' that bitch, hol' up,
Get a stolen vehicle, drive that bitch, hol' up
Pushin' yo' block, then we spray 'em, uh
Pushin' yo' block, then we spray 'em
Somebody send 'em a prayer
Somebody send 'em some prayers
I got some shit goin' crazy
I need a whole 'nother level
I'm on a whole 'nother level
I'm a different type of player
I'm a different type of player
I'm a creative player
Shawty knew where I was goin'
Shawty know I'm a slayer
Shawty, treat her like mail
Fuck 'em, we bring hell
Drive the coupe to Rodeo
I'm 'bout to give them some hell

[Chorus]
Upside-down cross tat' on my neck, shut 'em up, uh, uh
Upside-down cross tat' on my neck, shut 'em up
Upside-down cross tat' on my neck, shut 'em up, uh, uh
Upside-down cross tat' on my neck, shut 'em up, uh
The Bentley's parked outside
My broad tryna go for a ride
I put VETEMENTS right on her thighs
I put the mask on 'cause I be fried
All red, I stay with the Fives
All red, we pull up and fire
All red, somebody dyin'
All red, I pour up then drive
