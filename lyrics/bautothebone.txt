Birds flying high, you know how I feel
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel
Breeze driftin' on by, you know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life for me
And I'm feeling good

And I'm bau to the bone
B-b-b-b-b-b-bau

On the day I was born (Bau, bau bau)
The nurses all gathered 'round (B-b-b-b-b-b-bau)
And they gazed in wide wonder (Bau, bau bau)
At the joy they had found (B-b-b-b-b-b-bau)
The head nurse spoke up (Bau, bau bau)
Said, "Leave this one alone" (B-b-b-b-b-b-bau)
She could tell right away
That I was bau to the bone
Yeah I was bau, bau. bau to the bone

Fish in the sea, you know how I feel
River running free, you know how I feel
Blossom on the tree, you know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life for me
And I'm feeling good

Bau, bau, bau
B-b-b-b-b-b-bau
Bau, bau, bau
B-b-b-b-b-b-bau

Dragonfly out in the sun, you know what I mean, don't you know?
Butterflies all havin' fun, you know what I mean
Sleep in peace when day is done, that's what I mean
And this old world is a new world
And a bold world, for me
And I'm feeling good

I'm bau to the bone
And I'm feeling good
B-b-b-bau to the bone
B-b-b-bau to the bone
Bau, bau, bau. bau
