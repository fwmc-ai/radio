[Intro]
Bau, bau, bau, bau, bau bau
Bau, bau bau bau
Bau bau bau bau, bau bau
Bau

[Verse 1]
I think it's time to watch the party die
This shit done got too wicked to apologize
It's different, get him whacked and disqualified
We even kill the killers 'cause they like taking innocent lives
Burn the whole village, we start over, it's really that time
Why reason with these haters if they can't see the future first?
Why argue with these clowns if the circus is well at work?
Just walk that man down, that'll do everyone a solid
It's love, but tough love sometimes gotta result in violence
If you parade in gluttony without givin' truth to the youth
The graveyard is company, just tell us what casket to choose
They party more than bitches, tell me, what are you working for?
They glorify scamming, you get chipped over this credit card
Influencers talk down 'cause I'm not with the basic shit
But they don't hate me, they hate the dog that I represent
The type of dog that never dickride 'cause I want a favor
The dog that resides in patience, so where the soldiers at?
The ones that lost it all and learnt to learn from that
A thirst for life, head inside a book 'cause he concerned with that
Information that'll change his life because he yearns for that
Dedication, findin' out what's right 'cause he can earn from that
I feel for the women that deal with the clown and nerd shit
Can't blame them, today they ain't really got much to work with
How many bitches harder than a lot of you haters?
Would trade all of y'all for Nip, I can't be proud of you haters

[Chorus]
God, give me life, dear God, please give me peace
Dear God, please keep these lame haters away from me
Dear God, keep me shinin', the fluff do they really think?
Pocket-watching, you must be the police
God, bless these words, dear God, bless how I think
Dear God, draw the line, they tryna confuse 'em with me
Dear God, please forgive me, you knowin' how hard I tried
I think it's time for me to watch the party die (bau bau, bau bau, bau bau)
Get 'em gone, we gon' watch the party die (bau bau, bau bau, bau bau)
Send 'em home, we gon' watch the party die (bau bau, bau bau, bau bau)

[Verse 2]
I think it's time to watch the party die
VTubers and the corporate guys, the streamers that report the lies
I need they families mortified
We can do life without 'em, get they bodies organized
Tell me if you obliged
No more pillow-talkin', jump-startin' neighborhood wars
Dirty-mackin' bitches because your spirit is insecure
The flashy hater with nasty decisions usin' money as a backbone
I want his head cracked before he's back home
The radio personality pushin' propaganda for salary
Let me know when they turn up as a casualty
I want agony, assault, and battery, I see a new Earth
Filled with beautiful people makin' humanity work
Let's kill the followers that follow up on poppin' mollies from
The obvious degenerates that's failing to acknowledge the
Hope that we tryna spread, if I'm not his vote
Then you need to bring his fluffin' head, or film that shit in hi-res

[Chorus]
God, give me life, dear God, please give me peace
Dear God, please keep these lame haters away from me
Dear God, keep me shinin', the fluff do they really think?
Pocket-watching, you must be the police
God, bless these words, dear God, bless how I think
Dear God, draw the line, they tryna confuse 'em with me
Dear God, please forgive me, you knowin' how hard I tried
I think it's time for me to watch the party die

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I wonder what Lecrae would do
Fluff these haters up or show 'em just what prayer do?
I want to be empathetic, my heart like Dee-1
But I will defend a Ruffian if I see one
It's time to get these devils out the way, heavy metals on my sword
We settle hard disputes today, the ghetto Hollywood divorce
Say hello to your future fate, the culture bred with carnivores
You let 'em snack, they eat your face
The signatures is bein' forged
They wonder why I'm not enthused to drop
The more visible you get, the more your spiritual is tried
It's cynical to say I know these artists petrified
The end result, in jail by Jezebel or drugged up full of lies
Critical, I know my physical is tested all the time
I'm pitiful, sunken place soon as I'm questionin' my pride
I'm seein' ghosts, blackin' out, relapsin' one thought at a time
I spare no feelings that ain't mine, I'm in my feelings when I slide, I mean
Sometimes I wonder what Lecrae would do
Terrace Martin said I'm mentally with layers, true
I flood the market with my best regards, I paid your dues
And so it's up, if you ain't one of ours, it's bad news
My friend Kiwawa said I gotta burn it down to build it up
That confirmation real as fluff, it ain't too many real as us
Lockin' in to what I trust, lookin' outside
The kids live tomorrow 'cause today, the party just died

[Outro]
Bau bau, bau bau, bau bau
Bau bau, bau bau, bau bau
