[Verse]
I was wrestlin' like, should I write a verse?
The culture got enough clout-chasin' vultures out here tryna prove they worth
They need attention
They can't imagine me not tryna make myself look bigger off of this Kendrick mention
I can't imagine his position
Before I got on my mission I was a party victim
I brought the party favors
I used my trauma, my single mama, to justify commas to pay the devil's wages, woo, huh
That probably went over they heads
Basically what I said is I was government fed
Bred for doin' time in the feds, but Jesus bled
Instead of puttin' dents in they head, He turned His
My cup runneth over with nonsense
They hearts grow colder, they love to do evil, they burn they conscience
I want the dealer's head who gave my cousin fentanyl
Labels exploitin' rappin' addicts, man, I'm sick of y'all
My daddy ran with Compton Crips, my uncle's Piru
Stuck in the middle of this madness, what should I choose?
I should be choosin' between Howard and Hampton
I love the people that I ran with but look at the damage
You want me put you on but I know you still with the scammin'
A crooked doctor took advantage and hooked me on Xanax
It's killers sittin' in they cell for takin' somebody innocent
And they don't even feel no remorse, the worst ignorance
But when I take a look in the mirror
The blood of Uriah's on my hands 'cause I'm that killer
Who had Bathsheba in his quarters
I'm that sinner who let Eve taste the fruit of death, I'm that sinner
I deserve death along with these liars and hypocrites
Fake tough rappers who fabricate they predicaments
Fake-deep guru pushin' voodoo on the people
Tellin' folks that my God ain't real, that's real evil
Huh, I wonder what Lecrae would do
Hopefully seek the hand of God and tell 'em that he's incapable
But truthfully, I'm nobody to judge
My good deeds are like some period blood stains on a dirty rug
All that I can offer them is Jesus' love
I know it sound foolish to many, like "Really? That's all you got for us?"
Yeah, the cross is foolish to the perishin'
The world'll call me weak and the saints'll say I embarrass 'em
I walk through valleys full of evil, I'm aware of it
I can't condemn the world and burn all of the heretics
Love is patient so I'm trustin' in the narrative
And Christ ain't watch the party die, He died instead of it
