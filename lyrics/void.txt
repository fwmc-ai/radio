[Chorus]
Aye, leave me alone, Lean in the snow-cone
Got my cheese, provolone, money make me whole
Nah, I'm lying, it could never fill the void in my soul
Making out with the drugs, give 'em a kiss, then I'm gone
Travel the world, shows at the Gold Coast
Feel like James Bond, driftin' in a speedboat
You ain't hard, what you made of, of, of, of?
I just fucked twenty broads in my lair uh uh

[Verse]
I wonâ€™t answer, call my phone, I won't answer
When I was down on my own, ain't have no manners
Now they tryna join me 'cause they see me goin' bananas
Ape shit, no panda, Wraith shit
Like a race, shit, I'm livin' in the Matrix
I Molly pop, like a rave, bitch, my love is rage, bitch
I'm faded, fuck is you sayin'? I'm in an airplane
I made it, gambled all my chips like I'm in Vegas
Okay then, uh, say they wanna kill me, say they wanna drill me, uh
Okay then
Said she wanna know me, said she wanna feel me, bitch okay then
We can play then
I'ma hypnotize you with my voice and my cadence, yeah

[Chorus]
Leave me alone, Lean in the snow-cone
Got my cheese, provolone, money make me whole
Nah, I'm lying, it could never fill the void in my soul
Making out with the drugs, give 'em a kiss, then I'm gone
Travel the world, shows at the Gold Coast
Feel like James Bond, driftin' in a speedboat
You ain't hard, what you made of, of, of, of?
I just fucked twenty broads in my lair

[Verse 2]
Let's go, let's go, let's go, uh huh, bitch! Yeah
I ain't sippin' clean nothing, this some dirty fanta
With a bitch on my lap, like my first name Santa
You get jacked like a pumpkin no lantern
VVS on my ring like the Green Lantern
Anything besides money is kind of irrelevant
I can't focus without codeine, my medicine
Sip it til I'm slurring and spittin' impediments
I'm balling to the point that I think I need a letterman
I'm faded, I put your ass in a coma, okay then
Smoking kush, this aroma, bitch I made it
You know I'm the greatest
I'm gonna mesmerize you with my music, embrace it

[Chorus]
Leave me alone, Lean in the snow-cone
Got my cheese, provolone, money make me whole
Nah, I'm lying, it could never fill the void in my soul
Making out with the drugs, give 'em a kiss, then I'm gone
Travel the world, shows at the Gold Coast
Feel like James Bond, driftin' in a speedboat
You ain't hard, what you made of, of, of, of?
I just fucked twenty broads in my lair

[Outro]
Demons wanna hold me
Demons wanna steal me
That's my own sin
Say she want to love me
Say she want to heal me
Come try it
Until you're out of tries
Until you're out of time
But hopefully this time
It won't be a lie
Leave me alone, Lean in the snow-cone
Got my cheese, provolone, money make me whole
Nah, I'm lying, it could never fill the void in my soul
