[00:11.00]I was wrestlin' like, should I write a verse?
[00:14.00]The culture got enough clout-chasin' vultures out here tryna prove they worth
[00:19.00]They need attention
[00:20.50]They can't imagine me not tryna make myself look bigger off of this Kendrick mention
[00:24.50]I can't imagine his position
[00:26.90]Before I got on my mission I was a party victim
[00:30.00]I brought the party favors
[00:31.25]I used my trauma, my single mama, to justify commas to pay the devil's wages, woo, huh
[00:37.00]That probably went over they heads
[00:39.00]Basically what I said is I was government fed
[00:42.00]Bred for doin' time in the feds, but Jesus bled
[00:44.00]Instead of puttin' dents in they head, He turned His
[00:47.80]My cup runneth over with nonsense
[00:50.00]They hearts grow colder, they love to do evil, they burn they conscience
[00:53.00]I want the dealer's head who gave my cousin fentanyl
[00:56.00]Labels exploitin' rappin' addicts, man, I'm sick of y'all
[00:59.00]My daddy ran with Compton Crips, my uncle's Piru
[01:02.00]Stuck in the middle of this madness, what should I choose?
[01:05.00]I should be choosin' between Howard and Hampton
[01:07.00]I love the people that I ran with but look at the damage
[01:10.00]You want me put you on but I know you still with the scammin'
[01:13.00]A crooked doctor took advantage and hooked me on Xanax
[01:16.00]It's killers sittin' in they cell for takin' somebody innocent
[01:18.70]And they don't even feel no remorse, the worst ignorance
[01:22.00]But when I take a look in the mirror
[01:24.50]The blood of Uriah's on my hands 'cause I'm that killer
[01:28.00]Who had Bathsheba in his quarters
[01:29.80]I'm that sinner who let Eve taste the fruit of death, I'm that sinner
[01:34.00]I deserve death along with these liars and hypocrites
[01:37.00]Fake tough rappers who fabricate they predicaments
[01:40.00]Fake-deep guru pushin' voodoo on the people
[01:42.00]Tellin' folks that my God ain't real, that's real evil
[01:46.00]Huh, I wonder what Lecrae would do
[01:48.00]Hopefully seek the hand of God and tell 'em that he's incapable
[01:51.50]But truthfully, I'm nobody to judge
[01:54.00]My good deeds are like some period blood stains on a dirty rug
[01:57.00]All that I can offer them is Jesus' love
[02:00.00]I know it sound foolish to many, like "Really? That's all you got for us?"
[02:03.00]Yeah, the cross is foolish to the perishin'
[02:06.00]The world'll call me weak and the saints'll say I embarrass 'em
[02:09.00]I walk through valleys full of evil, I'm aware of it
[02:12.00]I can't condemn the world and burn all of the heretics
[02:15.00]Love is patient so I'm trustin' in the narrative
[02:17.80]And Christ ain't watch the party die, He died instead of it
