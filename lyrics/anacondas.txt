[Intro]
FWMC RADIO

[Chorus]
I keep on cutting it close (I'm cutting it close)
Feel like I may overload (Like I may overload)
She got big tits, motorboat (She got big tits, motorboat)
I met that bitch on the coast (I met that bitch on the coast)
I get her wet like a boat (Wet like a boat)
In the pussy, I'ma float (Pussy, I'ma float)
Feel like Lupe Fiasco
Kick push in it, I'ma coast (Push in it, I'ma coast)

[Post-Chorus]
Smokin' on Marijuana (Marijuana)
I can't feel my trauma (Trauma)
Where I come from it's a jungle (Brr)
Gotta watch for the anacondas (Watch for the anacondas)
It wouldn't be me, I was all on my own
Lonely road I'm runnin' (Road I'm runnin')
Ready to road run (Road run)
I'm a road runner (Road runner)

[Verse 1]
Usian Bolt, Sprintin' (Hm)
Bussin' them serves, tennis
I get what I deserve, I did it
Kick some people to the curb, I admit it
If it's smoke, get your block spinnin'
Following shots, out of a Glock, um
None of my shots missin'
Pass me the rock, I'll never stop, um
All of my shots, swishin'
Stay true to my lane, no switchin'
Got a vagina, bitches
Wet 'em up, wet 'em up, dirty dishes
These hoes see me in person they trippin'
Got 'em actin' like computers, they glitchin'
I could talk to the world and they listen
Mama told me I gotta make a difference

[Chorus]
I keep on cutting it close (I'm cutting it close)
Feel like I may overload (Like I may overload)
She got big tits, motorboat (She got big tits, motorboat)
I met that bitch on the coast (I met that bitch on the coast)
I get her wet like a boat (Wet like a boat)
In the pussy, I'ma float (Pussy, I'ma float)
Feel like Lupe Fiasco
Kick push in it, I'ma coast (Push in it, I'ma coast)

[Post-Chorus]
Smokin' on Marijuana (Marijuana)
I can't feel my trauma (Trauma)
Where I come from it's a jungle (Brr)
Gotta watch for the anacondas (Watch for the anacondas)
It wouldn't be me, I was all on my own
Lonely road I'm runnin' (Road I'm runnin')
Ready to road run (Road run)
I'm a road runner (Road runner)

[Verse 2]
I'm really startin' like guns (Hah)
Huh, the big ol' bau bau ones
Sound like I'm talkin' 'bout my dick or some'
Won't you suck a d-d-dick or some'?
In the stu', cookin' apron
My gun sound like Ableton
Diamonds on my wrist, weigh a ton
B-B-Big baguette rocks, gleam
Kickin' that shit like a soccer team
I told my baby I'll stop lean
I done moved on to finer things
Roxycontin that I pop, beans
Same way that bro pop the Glock, then squeeze
They be coming, you ready or not?
Soon as you fall asleep, they run in your spot
They stand over your bed, and put one in your top
Leave with no trace, killers is top notch
These Jeremy Scotts'll drop crotch
Redneck, hit 'em with a buck shot
Send 'em straight to the ER
Bullet hit 'em, now I'm screamin' out "Yee-Haw"
Blood on my Raf Simmons and Adidas
Let the Kel-Tec sing like la-di-da

[Chorus]
I keep on cutting it close (I'm cutting it close)
Feel like I may overload (Like I may overload)
She got big tits, motorboat (She got big tits, motorboat)
I met that bitch on the coast (I met that bitch on the coast)
I get her wet like a boat (Wet like a boat)
In the pussy, I'ma float (Pussy, I'ma float)
Feel like Lupe Fiasco
Kick push in it, I'ma coast (Push in it, I'ma coast)

[Post-Chorus]

Lonely road I'm runnin' (Road I'm runnin')
Ready to road run (Road run)
