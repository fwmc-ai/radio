[Intro: Amelia Watson]
I'll be home for Christmas
Whether everybody say
I'll be right there on my sleigh for you
I'll be home for Christmas
Fuck 'bout what they have to say
Pull up on you in the sleigh
Know you got them gifts for me, yeah, yeah
Hope you do them tricks for me, yeah, yeah
Know you on my list, shawty, yeah, yeah
Roll up somethin' lit for me, yeah, yeah
Baby, every Christmas Eve
Won't be right, you next to me
Tell me you gon' ride on my sleigh
Whatever you wanna see
Can I be all that you need
Every year on Christmas Eve?

[Chorus: Amelia Watson]
Now we ain't got to hit the club
Know you cold, let's bundle up
I'm just tryna get some love
I hope it wasn't obvious
It's a white Christmas at the crib
Tryna get snowed in
Unwrap you while we lay
Go and show me what it is

[Chorus: Gawr Gura]
Now we ain't got to hit the club
Know you cold, let's bundle up
I'm just tryna get some love
I hope it wasn't obvious
It's a white Christmas at the crib
Tryna get snowed in
Unwrap you while we lay
Go and show me what it is

[Verse 1: Gawr Gura]
Where you at? Come slide
I could really use a ride
When the Uber has arrived
I won't even come inside
I just wanna catch a ride
Roll a wood, catch a vibe
We could have a silent night
Long as I'm up by your side

[Verse 2: Amelia Watson]
You won't need them boots or the furs
Give it to you proper, yes sir
Stay the night, baby, here's a shirt
(I just need you next to me)
Let's get close and blame it all on the weather
Girl, you know you deserve so much better
Let's make a snowman and ball together
(Every year on Christmas Eve)

[Chorus: Amelia Watson]
Now we ain't got to hit the club
Know you cold, let's bundle up
I'm just tryna get some love
I hope it wasn't obvious
It's a white Christmas at the crib
Tryna get snowed in
Unwrap you while we lay
Go and show me what it is

[Chorus: Gawr Gura]
Now we ain't got to hit the club
Know you cold, let's bundle up
I'm just tryna get some love
I hope it wasn't obvious
It's a white Christmas at the crib
Tryna get snowed in
Unwrap you while we lay
Go and show me what it is

[Verse 3: Amelia Watson]
Girl, you saying that's facts
Tell me how you like my Santa hat
Good times, that's how we take it back
With the Al Green up in a bag
I make her scream, I'm Mr. Felcher
Yeah, while she cooking Hamburger Helper
She on the pole, she Santa's helper

[Verse 4: Chance The Rapper]
It ain't nothing no one can tell her
Hey lil' mama in the pink
You would look good in a mink
They all say the same thing
All my exes say jinx
What you want? Tryna link
Who all you tryin' to bring?
They ain't even gotta change
Let her jingle in her jeans

[Chorus: Amelia Watson & Gawr Gura]
Now we ain't got to hit the club
Know you cold, let's bundle up
I'm just tryna get some love
I hope it wasn't obvious
It's a white Christmas at the crib
Tryna get snowed in
Unwrap you while we lay
Go and show me what it is (Girl, you slay)
Now we ain't got to hit the club (I love her)
Know you cold, let's bundle up (Baby, you slay)
I'm just tryna get some love (I love her)
I hope it wasn't obvious (Girl, you slay)
It's a white Christmas at the crib (I love her)
Tryna get snowed in (Baby, you slay)
Unwrap you while we lay (I love her)
Go and show me what it is

[Outro: Gawr Gura]
Baby, you slay, I love her
Baby, you slay, I love her
Baby, you slay, I love her
Baby, you slay, I love her
