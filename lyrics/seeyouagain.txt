[Chorus: Minato Aqua]
It's been a long day
Without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way
From where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

[Verse 1: Minato Aqua]
Why'd you have to leave so soon? Yeah
Why'd you have to go?
Why'd you have to leave me when I needed you the most?
I don't really know how to tell you without feeling much worse
I know you're in a better place, but it's always gonna hurt

[Pre-Chorus: Minato Aqua]
Carry on
Give me all the strength I need
To carry on

[Chorus: Minato Aqua]
It's been a long day
Without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way
From where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2: A-Chan]
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standin' right here talkin' to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But somethin' told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place

[Refrain: A-Chan]
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standin' there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

[Chorus: Minato Aqua]
It's been a long day
Without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way
From where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

[Post-Chorus: Mococo Abyssgard]
Oh-oh-oh-oh (Uh, I'll see you again)
Oh-oh-oh-oh (Uh, know I'm gon' see you again)
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Uh, I'll see you again)
My friend, where it all began

[Verse 3: Mococo Abyssgard]
Uh, lookin' back now, know you hear me, wanna see me smile
Hold me down, keep me safe, when I'm down, not a sound
And ever since you was a child, always had your back 'til now
Shoulda kept the circle round, now it's like you not around
Used to run it through the town, toughest little dudes around
Always thought you have a daughter, sure to teach her what they taught us
Had a son, he gettin' smarter, every day more like his father
Know this game and keep it solid, present faith, know you got it
Big things come back again, but ain't the same
I tell myself, "Remain the same and keep it sane"
Know it's hard when your dawg ain't there to bark with ya
Seem like yesterday we was all in pictures

[Chorus: Elizabeth Rose Bloodflame]
It's been a long day
Without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way
From where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 4: A-Chan]
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feelin' strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond'll never be broken, the love will never get lost
And when brotherhood come first, then the line'll never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone

[Refrain: A-Chan]
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standin' there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

[Bridge: Minato Aqua]
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home

[Chorus: Minato Aqua]
It's been a long day
Without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way
From where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
When I see you again
See you again
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
