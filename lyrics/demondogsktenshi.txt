[Intro: FUWAMOCO]
Demon Dogs! Demon Dogs!
Bau bau bau bau bau!

[Chorus: FUWAMOCO]
We the demon dogs
Who are we?
FUWAMOCO, bau!
We the demon dogs
Who are we?
FUWAMOCO, bau!

[Verse: FUWAMOCO]
All the Ruffies go bau bau
When we pull up in a beam
Donuts in the lot
At Mister Donut, cause a scene
Bau bau on my wrist
Biboo dancing for nerizzler
Gura shark fin
Way we eat small fish for dinner
It’s the big pond now
Oops I meant the big pound
We the demon dogs
Now we gotcha hellbound
That’s a show
It’s Korean
And I’m out in Japan
But I don’t give a muk
It’s bang bang if I see em
Push your luck
And I’ll sick my sis on ya
Twins and they extend
Bau bau, OK-drama
We could clear the air
Pero eyes in the sky
FUWAMOCO glare
Pink & Blue, 4 eyes
Glasses for the toast
Nattō appetizer
Got it all on ‘Vid
Like we shot em with the Pfizer
Hololive rider
Treat us with respect
Karaoke money maker
I call that a mic check

[Chorus: FUWAMOCO]
We the demon dogs
Who are we?
FUWAMOCO, bau!
We the demon dogs
Who are we?
FUWAMOCO, bau!
We the demon dogs
Who are we?
FUWAMOCO, bau!
We the demon dogs
Who are we?
FUWAMOCO, bau!

[Verse 2: Mococo Abyssgard]
Yeah it’s Moco-chan
I got a milli stans
Heartthrob make ya heart stop
911 the call ambulance
They call me miss steal your man
But I never would, I just can
Don’t need a man when I got my sis
Don’t make that weird
See it goes a little something like this
We was down bad
Sitting in the pound, bad
Hit the ground bad
Things got real bad
I was sad but Fuwawa had my back
From the streets to The Holo and we never going back
Hows that

[Outro: FUWAMOCO]
Did I do okay, was that good?
Hahahaha
We the Demon Dogs
Who are we?
FUWAMOCO
We the Demon Dogs
Who are we?
FUWAMOCO
We the Demon Dogs
Who are we?
FUWAMOCO
