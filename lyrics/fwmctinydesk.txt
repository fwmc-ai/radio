[Song 1: Small Worlds]

[Chorus]
Yeah, the world is so small 'til it ain't, yeah
I'm buildin' up a wall 'til it break
She hate it when I call and it's late
I don't wanna keep you waitin'
I hope I never keep you waitin', yeah

[Verse 1]
I think I know it all but I don't
Why you always at the mall when you're broke? Yeah
And I just wanna ball
Maybe dunk, but I never been tall, yeah
I might trip, I never fall
God knows I came close
Don't try this at home
I know I probably need to do better
Fuck whoever, keep my shit together
You never told me bein' rich was so lonely
Nobody know me, oh well
Hard to complain from this five-star hotel
I'm always in a rush, I've been thinkin' too much, but
Keep it on the hush, no one need to know, just us

[Pre-Chorus]
That's really all it take
We don't need nothin' but today, today, today, today

[Chorus]
The world is so small 'til it ain't ('Til it ain't, 'til it ain't, 'til it ain't)
I'm buildin' up a wall 'til it break ('Til it break, 'til it break, 'til it break)
She hate it when I call and it's late (And it's late, and it's late)
I don't wanna keep you waitin'
I hope I never keep you waitin'

[Bridge]
Yeah, bau, bau, bau, bau
Bau, bau, bau, bau
Bau, bau, bau, bau
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Bau, bau, bau, bau
Bau, bau, bau, bau
Bau, bau, bau, bau

[Verse 2]
Yeah, got a bad attitude, playin' 'til I'm out of moves
No need for shame, I get mo' peace at slow speeds
Go beat the game, young control freak
It's cold in my veins, I'm below freezin', snow season made me
They know that I so need my space
Don't wanna grow old so I smoke just in case
She say that I glow below the waist
And the stroke is just so PGA
All I got is a little bit of space and time
Drawin' shapes and lines of a world we made
Tomorrow may be right around the corner
But I swear it's gon' be worth it if I make you wait
There's somewhere above you, keep reachin' up

[Pre-Chorus]
That's really all it take
We don't need nothin' but today, today, today, today

[Chorus]
The world is so small 'til it ain't ('Til it ain't, 'til it ain't, 'til it ain't)
I'm buildin' up a wall 'til it break ('Til it break, 'til it break, 'til it break)
She hate it when I call and it's late (And it's late, and it's late)
I don't wanna keep you waitin'
I hope I never keep you waitin'

[Verse 3]
Yeah, nine times out of ten, I get it wrong
That's why I wrote this song, tell myself to hold on
I can feel my fingers slippin', in a motherfuckin' instant, I'll be gone
Do you want it all if it's all mediocre?
Starin' at the wall and the wall full of posters
Lookin' at my dreams, who I wanna be?
I guess you gotta see it to believe
Ooh, I been a fool but it's cool, that's what human beings do
Keep your eyes to the sky, never glued to your shoes
Guess there was a time when my mind was consumed
But the sun comin' out now, clouds start to move
Don't tell me nothin' but the truth
I'm tired, I don't got a spare second
Win or lose, win or lose
I don't keep count, nobody checkin'


[Song 2: What's the Use?]

[Intro]
Oh yeah this song's called "What's the Use?"
That was called "Small Worlds"
That's enough talking
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
You can love it, you can leave it
They say you're nothin' without it
Don't let them keep you down
What if I don't need it?
There's somethin' about it
That just freaks me out
I just want another minute wit' it, fuck a little
What's the use?
Never superficial, you gon' know it when it hit you
Get a little sentimental when I'm off the juice

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Okay, we're colder than the breeze
But the breeze ain't flowin' like me, motherfucker, hol' up
You don't need to hol' up, yeah
And I can show you how I seem
What it is, what it truly might be, nothin' that you know of
You don't need to hol' up
I'm so a-bove and beyond
You take drugs to make it up way up where we on
Space shuttle, Elon
Time, we don't waste much, fuck when we wake up
Then I have her sing just like CÃ©line Dion
Catch me if you can but, you'll never catch me, damn
Whole lotta, "Yes, I am"
All the way in wit' no exit plan
Already left and the jet don't land
Yeah, the time is tickin', come take a ride, get inside
This is highly different, I'm talkin' fly, got a pilot wit' 'im, uh
Can I mind my business?
Why you trippin'? Give you somethin' that your eyes can witness
Ooh, you're too close
I don't understand why you doin' the most

[Chorus]
You can love it, you can leave it
They say you're nothin' without it
Don't let them keep you down
What if I don't need it?
There's somethin' about it
And that just freaks me out
I just want a 'nother minute wit' it
Fuck a little, what's the use? Yeah
What's the use? Yeah
Never super-ficial
You gon' know it when it hit you
Get a little senti-mental when I'm off the juice, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Well, I'ma give you what you came for, yeah
Shit, I've worked too hard to have a clue who you are
Set the bar so far above par, we can parlay all day
Crib long range with the yard
I know I should probably pray more but you gotta love me
'Cause I save the day, spend money
When I had nothin', shit, it wasn't so funny
Made a promise to the homies nobody go hungry
Look how far we came, still they throwin' dirt on my name
But it never worry my brain
Heads turnin' like a hurricane swervin'
Tell the sun, "Get up outta my shade"
If they don't get the picture, cut 'em outta that frame, shit
I'm up thirty thou' miles plus change
It's been a while but I'm down 'til I'm out
And it is what it is 'til it ain't, yeah

[Chorus]
You can love it, you can leave it
They say you're nothin' without it
Don't let them keep you down
What if I don't need it?
There's somethin' about it
And that just freaks me out
I just want a 'nother minute wit' it
Fuck a little, what's the use? Yeah
What's the use? Yeah
Never super-ficial
You gon' know it when it hit you
Get a little senti-mental when I'm off the juice, yeah


[Song 3: 2009]

[Chorus]
Yeah, I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and
She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and
I ain't askin' "Why?" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door

[Verse 1]
Yeah, okay, you gotta jump in to swim
Well, the light was dim in this life of sin
Now every day I wake up and breathe
I don't have it all but that's alright with me
Take it nice and easy, took a flight to see me
Send you back home with a light that's beamin'
The whole team 'bout to figure it out
We ice cold, that's what winter about
And sometimes, sometimes I wish I took a simpler route
Instead of havin' demons that's as big as my house, mhmm
Have a ball with a dribble and bounce
'Cause the party ain't over 'til they're kickin' me out, yeah
Isn't it funny? We can make a lot of money
Buy a lot of things just to feel a lot of ugly
I was yea high and muddy
Lookin' for what was lookin' for me

[Chorus]
But I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and
She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and
I ain't askin' "Why?" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door

[Verse 2]
Yeah, they ask me what I'm smilin' for
Well, because I've never been this high before
It's like I never felt alive before
Mhmm, I'd rather have me peace of mind than war
See, me and you, we ain't that different
I struck the fuck out and then I came back swingin'
Take my time to finish, mind my business
A life ain't a life 'til you live it, I was diggin' me a hole
Big enough to bury my soul
Weight of the world, I gotta carry my own
My own, with these arms I can carry you home
I'm right here when you scared and alone, and I ain't never in a hurry
You don't ever gotta worry
Even when it's 7:30 and the time is runnin' low
When your heart get cold
See what's behind all them unturned stones
And I'm a pro when it come to my job
But really I'm just tryna start believin' in God
Now when it gets hard
I don't panic, I don't sound the alarm

[Chorus]
Because I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and
She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and
I ain't askin' "Why?" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door
Okay, I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and
She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and
I ain't askin' "Why?" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door
