[Verse 1 Start: Gawr Gura]
I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about

[Nanashi Mumei]
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house

[Gawr Gura]
But today, I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around

[Nanashi Mumei]
And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt

[Gawr Gura]
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about

[Nanashi Mumei]
Today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

[Chorus Start: Nanashi Mumei]
And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one

[Gawr Gura]
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me

[Nanashi Mumei]
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

[Verse 2 Start: Gawr Gura]
And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but

[Nanashi Mumei]
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do

[Gawr Gura]
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs

[Nanashi Mumei]
And pictured I was driving home to you

[Chorus Start: Gawr Gura]
And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one, oh

[Nanashi Mumei & Gawr Gura]
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone

[Gawr Gura & Nanashi Mumei]
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

[Bridge: Nanashi Mumei & Gawr Gura]
Red lights, stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue, know we're through
But I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

[Chorus: Gawr Gura & Nanashi Mumei]
I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

[Outro: Gawr Gura]
Yeah, you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
