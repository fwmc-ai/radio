[Part 1: Gawr Gura - Best Person You Know]

[Verse 1]
I'm so confused
Don't know what to do
I feel lost sitting alone in my room
Get your pride out of my face
You tell me it will be okay
The words that you say don't make you any more of a man
Miss seeing things being done with your hands

[Chorus]
Do you believe in God or anything at all?
What morals do you stand by?
Have your standards started to fall?
Do you believe in God?

[Verse 2]
What makes you build yourself so high?
Can't see you anymore
It's almost like the features of your face are indescribable
Eat the shit that you've made
Go sit in that grave, the one that you've dug for yourself
I don't care, your body isn't mine
You're no longer mine

[Chorus]
Do you believe in God or anything at all?
What morals do you stand by?
Have your standards started to fall?
Do you believe in God?
Do you believe in?
Do you believe in?
God
God


[Part 2: Hakos Baelz - Feral Rat Anthem]

[Verse 1]
You tend to hit me up late nights at 2 AM
Sliding into anyone that you can find's DMs
Makes sense that there's no proof of stable friends
Pathological liar burning at both ends

Spewing toxic things that I just can't take seriously
Ridiculous it took us way too long to check under your sleeves
But you faked it and you made it easy to see
You were never worthy of our time bring you to your knees

[Chorus]
Cause four's a package deal for fucking you over
Bar is on floor it can't go any lower
And you can go and rot in hell
I really hope you learn to never forgive yourself
Because evеryone knows you're a lying cheat
And I hopе you're always always feeling always feeling incomplete

[Verse 2]
You sat there and juggled all of us
But even clowns are good at that and you keep on fucking it up
I don't know what to call you
Are you even in remorse?
Turned off your lights and your phone and you told yourself that it could be worse

[Pre-Chorus]
None of this is fucking tight
None of this has ever been right
None of this is fucking tight
None of this has ever been right
None of this is fucking right
None of this has ever been right

[Chorus]
Cause four's a package deal for fucking you over
Bar is on floor it can't go any lower
And you can go and rot in hell
I really hope you learn to never forgive yourself
Because evеryone knows you're a lying cheat
And I hopе you're always always feeling always feeling incomplete
