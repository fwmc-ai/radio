[Intro]
Good evening and welcome!
I'm Koseki Bijou sparkling gem of Hololive English Advent
A drink? Some snacks?
Or a little rock?

[Verse 1]
Mocktails, mixers, ice
The snacks are real nice
Soda, sour-mix, dry
I'm lit, you can't deny
Whatever you want
Whatever you need
So good you'll never
Ever want to leave
Anything that you desire
Set it on fire!

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll Biboo Tax you every single day
How could I not?
You know I'm the real deal
What's left to say?
Three, two, one, rock!

[Chorus]
Koseki, Koseki, Koseki
Go-go!
Koseki, Koseki,
Oh a little rock!
Koseki, Koseki, Koseki
Go-go!
Koseki, Koseki,
Turning you to stone!

[Verse 2]
I look kinda cute and nice 'n' pleasant
But I got a short fuse for fools
Don't get arrogant
Watch out! Let me pour you a drink
But think about messing with me
I'll end you in a blink
So drink your drink, don't you run your mouth
You think about stepping to me, and things'll go south
Wanna push your luck then O-K-K
I'm gonna turn you to stone
Think twice before you play, play

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll Biboo Tax you every single day
How could I not?
You know I'm the real deal
What's left to say?
Three, two, one, rock!

[Chorus]
Koseki, Koseki, Koseki
Go-go!
Koseki, Koseki,
Oh a little rock!
Koseki, Koseki, Koseki
Go-go!
Koseki, Koseki,
Turning you to stone!

[Outro]
It's so catchy!
