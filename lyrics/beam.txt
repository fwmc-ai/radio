[Verse 2: Filian]
My life off a beam
Out of frequency
I just fucked a bitch named Wendy, she's so mean
Uh, I just fucked two bitches, Siamese
Pull-pull up, make a scene, I collect my fee, uh
When I make a move, light is always green, uh
I just hit it once, she became a fiend
Grind-grindin' all up on me, juices on my jeans (Ayy)
Laser beamin' galaxy
That bitch flat, B.o.B
I'm on Neptunes, Pusha T
