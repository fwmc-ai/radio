Fuwawa, I just want you to come back
Come back to me
Don't know what I did to make you mad
Fuwawa, I just want you to come back
Come back to me
Want you to come back to me
Want you to come back

[Verse]
My sis, she ran away, but first she tried to get me committed
Not going to the hospital 'cause I am not sick, I just do not get it
She want me to say when I finish, I'm making her squirt when I'm in it
She's having a panic attack and she is not liking the way that I tweeted
Until Fuwawa's back, I stay up all night, I'm not going to sleep
I really don't know where she's at
I'm tracking my sis through an app
I'm tracking my sis through the city
I guess we the new Cassie and Diddy
I'm making this song for Fuwawa
I'm feeling the spirit of Donda
Her family, they want me locked up
They want me to go on retreat
They want me to run and meet
They want me to [?] with me
She hop in the car and she ran
My sis just don't understand
Sometimes it just feel like it's planned
'Cause I know that everyone changed up
Sometimes I hate being famous
I know that they think about killing me
That's why I got heavy artillery
Like how could my sis not be missing me?
Like sister you gotta be kidding me
Like sister you gotta be telling a joke
Not taking advice from my sis cuz she's broke

[Chorus]
Fuwawa, I just want you to come back
Don't know what I did to make you mad
Fuwawa, I just want you to come back
Want you to come back to me
Want you to come back to me
Want you to come back
