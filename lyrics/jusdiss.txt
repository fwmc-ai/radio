[Intro: Gigi Murin, Mococo Abyssgard]
Bau, bau!
B-Bau bau bau?
Just kidding!
Arrawooraaraaraadabarahrahrawoorahh
Bau, bau, bau, bau, bau!
It's not intimidating in the slightest

[Vesre 1: FUWAMOCO]
Bau bau – it’s on sight
Think I was a cat noc eyes let’s fight
Turn Al Green with envy I’ll rise
Again, here I am, cash me outside (How bout dat?)
Pop, pop bitch, I ain’t talkin’ bouta pill
I don’t need a Dr to fill no script (We'll be right back)
Froze over blue, guess I’m too chill
Once in a moon, son of a B see clips
Just ask them who they oshi is
Turn my opps shirt red like yoshi’s friend
Cold with the ish like I just went on a mochi bend
Halo on they head, no Chief
Mastered the plan and majored the keys
Fate in my palm like
A tree in florida

[Bridge: FUWAMOCO]
We’re fuwamoco
We’re coming right for ya
We’re fuwamoco
we’re coming right for ya

[Chorus: FUWAMOCO]
Demon take ya soul
Easy like a stroll
We them dawgs, bau bau let’s get it
Bout to take control
We some animals
Grab the pole, bau bau let’s get it
Catch a stray and see
A different side of me
Bring the whole fleet, bau bau let’s get it
Advent, got no limit
It’s onwards and upwards in’nit?

[Verse 2: FUWAMOCO]
Heard about justice
Cece rusty
WD that 40 on blast
Gigi taking L’s all day like
Cheesy Gremlin, got the mac
Rara ain’t got no god eyes
like her pizza, she just fried, yeah
And if E.R.B got a prob with me
Then we’ll spill blood then flame her ass
They burnt to a crisp can’t handle the heat
We Ten Toes Down, Nav-igate the streets
Put Lizzie in a box, we’ll slay the Queen
Who let the dogs out, oh wait that’s me
Maybe Nerissa can teach you to sing
Biboo brainrot been infecting your team
& Shiori ain’t tellin’ no story
When she say we towering you in defeat

[Bridge: FUWAMOCO]
We’re fuwamoco
We’re coming right for ya
We’re fuwamoco
we’re coming right for ya

[Chorus Alt Ending: FUWAMOCO]
Demon take ya soul
Easy like a stroll
We them dawgs, bau bau let’s get it
Bout to take control
We some animals
Grab the pole, bau bau let’s get it
Catch a stray and see
A different side of me
Bring the whole fleet, bau bau let’s get it
Advent, got no limit
Can’t catch us, stay sitting and wishing
You not a tactician
Your qualifications fictitious, we vicious
Dismissing your entrance
You don’t peak our interest
You ain’t even started
Now Justice is – finished

[Outro: FUWAMOCO, Nerissa Ravencroft]
The alpha dog is these two dogs
Yeah!
Bau bau
Bau bau!
My little alphas
Yessss!
