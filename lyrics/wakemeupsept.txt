[Intro]
I'm announcing the conclusion of my -- uh, Amelia Watson's general activities

[Verse 1]
Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
(So yeah, my last stream will be September 30th)
Like my father's come to pass
Seven years has gone so fast
Wake me up when September ends
(I apologize for that, I let the anxiety get the better of me)

[Chorus]
Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are
As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends
(I know it might be hard to see now,
But I do think everything is going to turn out okay)

[Verse 2]
Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Ring out the bells again
Like we did when spring began
Wake me up when September ends

[Chorus]
Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are
As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends
(I feel like you guys also helped me believe in myself
You guys taught me that the AmeWay is too strong, stubborn
So thank you again...)

[Verse 3]
Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Like my father's come to pass
Twenty years has gone so fast
Wake me up when September ends
Wake me up when September ends
Wake me up when September ends

[Outro]
I will see you... tomorrow.
