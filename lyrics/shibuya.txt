[Intro]
The announcement is that we're moving to Japan!
Bau bau!
We prepared a little bit of a letter to be able to share some of our feelings
I'll read it okay?
Dear Ruffians,

[Chorus]
Yeah, let me see your hands to bring you outside in my land (Yeah)
I've been with the gangsters, bandanas (Yeah)
Hangin' out the window, let it bang

[Post-Chorus]
For the right price, he'll do ya
That's my right-hand man (Right hand man)
We out in Shibuya, outside in Japan (Yeah, Japan)
Striped sweater on me like Krueger, huh, what's it to ya?
Introduce you to my new gun, this Ruger in my pants (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Yeah, let me see your hands to bring you outside in my land (Yeah)
I've been with the gangsters, bandanas (Yeah)
Hangin' out th–µ window, let it bang

[Verse]
You can see they on treason, I swear that they switch
I just needed a reason, already dug his ditch (Yuh)
They say I'm on fire like a nineteenth-century witch
No snow on tha bluff, the wire, they think I'm 50 Cent, uh
I've been hittin' stains, vool, you too?
Let's be Bonnie, Clyde, fuck ya sayin'?
We gon' be like Pablo Esco'
We don't need no fuckin' middle man

[Chorus]
Let me see your hands to bring you outside in my land (Yeah)
I've been with the gangsters, bandanas (Yeah)
Hangin' out the window, let it bang

[Post-Chorus]
For the right price, he'll do ya
That's my right-hand man (Right hand man)
We out in Shibuya, outside in Japan (Yeah, Japan)
Striped sweater on me like Krueger, huh, what's it to ya?
Introduce you to my new gun, this Ruger in my pants (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Yeah, let me see your hands to bring you outside in my land (Yeah)
I've been with the gangsters, bandanas
Hangin' out the window, let it bang

[Outro]
