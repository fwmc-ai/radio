[Chorus]
This might (Huh)
This might cause an argument after I say this
But last night, I called my ex when I was faded (Ah, yeah)
And maybe I'm bein' too truthful right now
Because every time that you play this
It's gon' fill your heart up with hatred (Yeah, ooh-ooh)

[Verse 1]
Okay, mind you, I'm the most hated
Talkin' down on me online, but in real life, you know I'm your favorite
You were to write me a thank you letter, it'd be long as the motherfuckin' yellow pages
And it still wouldn't be enough, I won't take it
I used to love you, now I fuckin' hate you
It's crazy

[Verse 2]
I used to buy you stilettos and Birkins
I don't know why 'cause you wouldn't be here if I was hurtin'
I tried to erase you out my mind, all things was fine 'til I closed the curtain
I used to look at you like a God, knowin' damn well you an average person
I can't deal when you get blacked out like a thick bedroom curtain
Lookin' strong on the outside, but the inside of you hurtin'
Shit got way too complicated, I just want to moist you out like lotion
Do your new man have motion?
I heard he be sippin' on green and yellow like he really support Oakland

[Verse 3]
When I'm high, I don't like to be social
But for you, I did it to get closer
I feel sorry for him
'Cause I set the bar real high, yeah, I had you coastal
I bossed up on you just like I told you
Went to Paris, now I don't even know you
Walkin' 'round in this bitch like I owe you
Doin' everything that you're supposed to

[Chorus]
Yeah, this might
This might cause an argument after I say this, huh
But last night, I called my ex when I was faded
And maybe I'm bein' too truthful right now
Because every time that you play this
It's gon' fill your heart up with hatred, I know

[Verse 4]
I know she saw the pictures of us out in public
She hit me like, "Was this all just for nothing?"
Trust me, that was a difficult discussion
I'm at this party, I don't know nobody
And I'm on some shit that is not for consumption
Stop tryna argue and make assumptions
We could be doing something more productive, uh
I'll take you to Turks, no TSA clearance
I'ma show you I'm serious

[Verse 5]
I get my assistants to handle your errands
Grateful for your parents (Uh-huh)
When it come to you, no, I'm not sharin' (Uh-huh)
I'ma put you so deep in Bottega, get rid of that old shit you was wearin' (Hm)
Are you in trouble Ruffians? Toast
And I'm obviously doin' the most for you
Baby girl, 'cause you deserve it
You keep me calm when I'm nervous (Uh-huh)
I never second guess making any kind of purchase on you (For sure)
I treat you like I'm tryna bribe ya (For sure)
Double Cs on your visor (For sure)
You're better looking than a model (For sure)

[Chorus]
Yeah, this might
This might cause an argument after I say this, huh
But last night, I called my ex when I was faded
And maybe I'm bein' too truthful right now
Because every time that you play this
It's gon' fill your heart up with hatred, I know
This might cause an argument after I say this, huh
But last night, I called my ex when I was faded
And maybe I'm bein' too truthful right now
Because every time that you play this
It's gon' fill your heart up with hatred, yeah
