[Intro]
*HUAM*
I'm gonna bite you
Don't say anything mean to me um.. umm...
It's my birthday!
Do you see this face?
And you're bullying me?
This is the face that you're bullying
Do you see this?
How could you?
How could you???


[Verse 1]
Every single morning
I hear my alarm clock ringing
Like it's wrong to just be chilling
Haven't I told you not to wake me up?

[Verse 2]
There will be time
To act all grown up
Why can't you just stop and listen?
Let's do what I want

[Pre-Chorus]
On Monday, wanna hang out with friends
Tuesday, I'll try all the best cakes
Get out the way or have a taste of
My scissors

[Chorus]
Can feel my patience running thin
Oh, I wish that you could just take it easy
Laid back vibes is the way I roll so
Get off my tail or else
You will get to say
Hello to my jaws
This shark's got a bite, don't you know?

[Verse 3]
I count one, two, but I can't catch the three
I'd like every second and evеry minute of my day to be mellow and free
But you said work, right?
I'll do it just finе
Don't underestimate me, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
On Friday, it's goodbye to classes
Saturday, I put on my best dress
Get out the way or have a taste of
My scissors

[Chorus]
Can feel my patience running thin
Oh, I wish that you could just take it easy
Laid back vibes is the way I roll so
Get off my tail or else
You will get to say
Hello to my jaws
This shark's got a bite, don't you know?

[Post-Chorus]
Don't you know?
You should know that
I'll bite 'em all
[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
This shark's got a bite, you know?
I'll hurry up and get it done (Oh)
But don't run my patience to the ground (Don't you know)
If you need me here
This shark's got a bite, don't you know?
(Oh) Yeah, you better keep it fun
When I try I'm second to none (Oh-oh-ooo)
You will get to say
Hello to my jaws
This shark's got a bite, don't you know?
