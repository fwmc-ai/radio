[Chorus]
She say, "Yes, sir, um, I got a man but your investor" (Woah)
I can turn a little bitch that's nothin' to the best her
I could jet her, but that's only if they, uh, let her (Hey)
Said she want me, said she love me, I never met her
Catch her, give her Ryback, intercept her
I can't catch none, yeah, you know I am a tester
Pop a E in electric car, that's a Tesla

[Verse]
She got bald P-U-S-S-Y, Uncle Fester (Woah)
I am not a clown, see, but this a small gesture
Yes, I blessed her, like she sneezed, woah, I can jet her (Ah-choo)
Yes, sir, I got cheese, woah, like I'm Chester
"Yes, sir", that's what she say when she want somethin' (Huh?)
"Yes, sir", that's what she say when the check come (Huh?)
"Yes, sir", that's what she say, bih', like come home (Huh?)
Yes, sir, this is really another brother home (Woo)
Yes, sir, she on period, beat it Redrum
Yes, sir, you keep callin' her, she got a dead phone (Hello?)
Yes, sir, pussy so wet, it's on monsoon
Yes, sir, she gon' come back 'cause you my clone
She call me Edgar, like a Mexican, sauce on sazón
I might flex again, she got estrogen, that be slime, holmes
BBL on them, I got extra tens, I got side hoes
CDL on front eighteen-wheeler, bring in my dough

[Chorus]
