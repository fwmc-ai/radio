[Gawr Gura]
Poolside convo about your summer last night

[Mori Calliope]
I'll be the boyfriend in your wet dreams tonight
Noses on a rail, little virgin wears the white

[Takanashi Kiara]
You cut your hair, but you used to live a blonded life
Wish I was there, wish we'd grown up on the same advice
And our time was right

[Gawr Gura]
Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing
It's nothing, it's nothing
Keep a place for me, for me

[Ninomae Ina'nis]
Now and then, you miss it, sounds make you cry
Some nights, you dance with tears in your eyes
I came to visit 'cause you see me like a UFO
That's like never

[Watson Amelia]
'Cause I made you use your self-control
And you made me lose my self-control, my self-control
Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing

[Mori Calliope, Ninomae Ina'nis]
Keep a place for me, for me

[Takanashi Kiara, Watson Amelia]
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing

[Gawr Gura]
It's nothing, it's nothing

[Mori Calliope]
I, I, I know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summertime
Give up

[Takanashi Kiara]
For the night, night, night
I, I, I know you got someone comin'
You're spittin' game, know you got it

[Gawr Gura]
I, I, I know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summertime
Give up

[Ninomae Ina'nis]
For the tonight, night, night
I, I, I know you got someone comin'
You're spittin' game, know you got it

[Watson Amelia]
I, I, I know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summertime
Give up

[HoloMyth]
For tonight, 'night, 'night
I, I, I know you got someone comin'
You're spittin' game, know you got it
