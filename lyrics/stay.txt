[Intro: Mococo Abyssgard]
Yeah, now you can never leave my side
I tricked you
Of course I'll never leave yours either
Protecting your smile is my duty as a guard dog

[Chorus: Nyatasha Nyanners]
I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
I know that I can’t find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey (Oh)

[Verse 1: FUWAMOCO]
I get drunk, wake up, I'm wasted still
I realize the time that I wasted here
I feel like you can't feel the way I feel
Oh, I’ll be fucked up if you can't be right here

[Pre-Chorus: Nyatasha Nyanners]
Oh, ooh-woah (Oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah)
Oh, ooh-woah (Oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah)
Oh, ooh-woah (Oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah)
Oh, I'll be fucked up if you can't be right here

[Chorus: Nyatasha Nyanners]
I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey
I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey

[Verse 2: FUWAMOCO]
When I’m away from you, I miss your touch (Bau, bau)
You’re the reason I believe in love
It's been difficult for me to trust (Bau, bau)
And I’m afraid that I'ma fuck it up
Ain't no way that I can leave you stranded
'Cause you ain’t ever left me empty-handed
And you know that I know that I can't live without you
So, baby, stay

[Pre-Chorus: Nyatasha Nyanners]
Oh, ooh-woah (Oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah)
Oh, ooh-woah (Oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah)
Oh, ooh-woah (Oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah)
I'll be fucked up if you can't be right here

[Chorus: Nyatasha Nyanners]
I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey
I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey

[Outro: Fuwawa Abyssgard]
Thank you so much for being by my side
With me and Moco-chan
Woah-oh
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey
