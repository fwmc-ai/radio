[Intro]
Well, howdy there partner
You're listening to FWMC-AI Radio

[Chorus]
I been putting work in all week long
Now I'm turnt up, tryna get me some
Drugs, money, pussy and beer
Found out I'm not the only one
So I curved that bitch and I moved right on to
Drugs, money, pussy and beer

[Verse 1]
Just one of those days, one of those weeks (Damn)
First things first, sex tape got leaked (Got leaked)
Forty million people watchin' me clap cheeks
At least I layed it down, might have to retweet

[Pre-Chorus]
Dope, cash, coochie and drank
Hit the liquor store on the way to the bank
Call my plug, just had an epiphany
Let's add one more to the holy trinity

[Chorus]
I been putting work in all week long
Now I'm turnt up, tryna get me some
Drugs, money, pussy and beer
Found out I'm not the only one
So I curved that bitch and I moved right on to
Drugs, money, pussy and beer

[Verse 2]
Hey, next thing I know, coochie on my breath
I got every drug in my system 'cept meth
Ten-thirty racks in the fridge
'Boutta go fishin', might catch me a bitch

[Pre-Chorus]
Meds, guap, nookie and juice
Sippin' moonshine while I'm stackin' my loot
Get some party favors then I knock me some boots
Forty-five back shots, fucked twenty-two's

[Chorus]
I been putting work in all week long
Now I'm turnt up, tryna get me some
Drugs, money, pussy and beer
Found out I'm not the only one
So I curved that bitch and I moved right on to
Drugs, money, pussy and beer

[Bridge]
Said, "Beer me, homie
Crack open that thirty rack"
Said, "Cheers me, homie
I don't care if it's wine or crack"
Wanna get shitfaced
Wanna stand up on the table
DMPB, that's my old fuckin' faithful
Beer me, homie, beer me, homie

[Chorus]
I been putting work in all week long
Now I'm turnt up, tryna get me some
Drugs, money, pussy and beer
Found out I'm not the only one
So I curved that bitch and I moved right on to
Drugs, money, pussy and beer
