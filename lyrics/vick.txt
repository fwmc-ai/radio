[Intro: Mori Calliope, Gawr Gura]
Okay Fuwawa
Okay Mococo
You asked for it
You asked for it
Gurrra

[Chorus: Mori Calliope]
It’s that Calliope
It’s that Calliope
It’s that Calliope
It’s that Calliope
Listen up lil pup
Time to say the name right
Woulda hit up Michael Vick
If i was looking for a dog fight

We just getting started
Run it back

It’s that Calliope
It’s that Calliope
Listen up lil pup
Time to say the name right
Woulda hit up Michael Vick
If i was looking for a dog fight

[Verse 1: Mori Calliope]
Opened up your mouth
Made me bring out an original
I don’t have to think about it
It’s subliminal
You two doing minimal
Cover songs so trivial
Crazy how you picked your looks
But still ugly every time you go digital
Quit it with the bau bau
I’ll say ruffie if I wanna
Backrooms, liminal
I got space for all my guala
Saucing like Marsala, Ruffie
Fitting, cuz you dogs some chickens
Reaper status, baby
You DMed for repentance
I could air receipts
Invalidate your sentence
Send you to the streets
What’s this? A couple kittens?
Don’t like it when I’m tough
Cuz you went fluffing soft
I mean check the sub count
I’m Lil Wayne, you “a milli” off

[Chorus: Mori Calliope]
It’s that Calliope
It’s that Calliope
It’s that Calliope
It’s that Calliope
Lil pup, lil pup
Time to say the name right
Woulda hit up Michael Vick
If i was looking for a dog fight

It’s that Calliope
It’s that Calliope
It’s that Calliope
It’s that Calliope
Listen up lil pup
Time to say the name right
Woulda hit up Michael Vick
If i was looking for a dog fight

[Verse 2: Gawr Gura]
Had no reason to start beef with me
You see two dogs? I see chum up in the sea
Had to go and mess with my bestie
Why’d you have to mess with my bestie?
First generation, we ain’t wait to succeed
you barely made it to the big 3
it took two of you, it only ever took one of me
Smalla but a baller
I be jumpin’ shots
Like I got ADHD
I’mma add my lot to the pot
Stir to hate me
I know that you hate me
I know that you hate me
Yeah, family matters
And I know you can relate, B
And yes that stand for Bau
What you should do before your queen
When I look at all your numbers
Wonder why you even stream
Gura I’m The Act 
Get Comfy like Uno
Go off do your dos thing
While we joke about you Cujo
Gura is the name
That’s something you can’t forget
I’m the big shark
You a little dogfish

[Chorus: Mori Calliope]
It’s that Calliope
It’s that Calliope
It’s that Calliope
It’s that Calliope
Listen up lil pup
Time to say the name right
Woulda hit up Michael Vick
If i was looking for a dog fight

It’s that Calliope
It’s that Calliope
It’s that Calliope
It’s that Calliope
Listen up lil pup
Time to say the name right
Woulda hit up Michael Vick
If i was looking for a dog fight
