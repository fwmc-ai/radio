While my time here may be coming to an end
I will cherish the memories that we've made together forever

Oooo, oooooo
Ooooo, ooooooo-oooo
Oooooo

Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
And the dreams that you dream of
Once in a lullaby

Oh, somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
And the dreams that you dream of
Dreams really do come true

Someday I'll wish upon a star
Wake up where the clouds are far behind....me
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
High above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

Oh, Somwhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
And the dream that you dare to
Why oh why can't I

Well I see trees of green
And red roses too
I watch them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

Well I see skies of blue
And I see clouds of white
And the brightness of day
I like the dark
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

The colors of the rainbow
So pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people passing by
See friends shakin hands saying
'How do you do?'
They're really sayin,'I, I love you."

I hear babies cryin
And are lost in hope
They'll know much more than we'll ever know
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

Oh, someday I'll wish upon a star
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
High above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

Oh, somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
And the dreams that you dare to
Why oh why can't I...I

Ooooo,oooo,ooooo,ooooo,oooo,oooo......

There's -- there's a love that I dream of
Once in a lullaby
