[Intro: Gawr Gura]
A, A, A, A, A, a

[Verse 1: Gawr Gura]
Day and night (Bau, bau)
I toss and turn, I keep stressing my mind, mind (Bau, bau)
I look for peace but see I don't attain (Bau, bau)
What I need for keeps this silly game we play, play

[Verse 1: Mococo Abyssgard]
Now look at this (Bau, bau)
Madness to magnet keeps attracting me, me (Bau, bau)
I try to run but see I'm not that fast (Bau, bau)
I think I'm first but surely finish last, last

[Chorus: Mococo Abyssgard, Gawr Gura]
'Cause day and night(day and night)
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night (night)
He's all alone through the day and night (day and night)
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night (at, at, at night)
Day and night (day and night)
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night (night)
He's all alone, some things will never change (never change)
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night (at, at, at night)

[Verse 2: Gawr Gura]
Hold the phone (Bau, bau)
The lonely stoner, Mr. Solo Dolo (Bau, bau)
He's on the movе can't seem to shake the shade (Bau, bau)
Within his drеams he see's the life he made, made

[Verse 2: Mococo Abyssgard]
The pain is deep (Bau, bau)
A silent sleeper you won't hear a peep, peep (Bau, bau)
The girl he wants don't seem to want him to (Bau, bau)
It seems the feelings that she had are through, through

[Chorus: Mococo Abyssgard, Gawr Gura]
'Cause day and night (day and night)
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night (night)
He's all alone through the day and night (day and night)
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night (at, at, at night)
Day and night (day and night)
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night (night)
He's all alone, some things will never change (yeah, never change)
The lonely loner seems to free his mind (yeah) at night
(At, at, yeah, at night)

[Verse 3: Elizabeth Rose Bloodflame]
Lemme get my big Busta Rhyme on
Or my Eminem Rap God shine on
Or my King Kendrick, send a message
To everybody online who be late to sign on
For them I got a quest-ion
Tell me what all of these things on this list have in common
A LION, a mattress, black actor or actress
They all get slept on
Got my tunes on your phone
Then my music is known as a monster living in your pocket
Thank you for choosing the flow
But you truly should know, you couldn’t come close to catch it or stop it
My stock is on the rise, Nintendo
Or crescendo, drop another line, cash a dollar every time, got a wallet full of dimes
When I shock em in the skies, my reign is torrential
Heat the climate whenever the rhyme hit
One of a kind, many couldn’t define it
Son of a gun, I am breaking the silence
I end the violence and kill em with kindness
I’m a plus while you suckaz is minus
I’d have your back but ya undercovers are spineless
I tour so much they call me the pilot
You a joke, you belong on Gilligan’s Island

[Verse 4: Gawr Gura, Mococo Abyssgard]
Slow mo, (Bau, bau)
When the tempo slows up and creates that new, new (Bau, bau)
He seems alive though he is feeling blue (Bau, bau)
The sun is shining man he's super cool, cool
The lonely nights (Bau, bau)
They fade away he slips into his white Nikes (Bau, bau)
He smokes a clip and then he's on the way (Bau, bau)
To free his mind in search of
To free his mind in search of
To free his mind in search of

[Chorus: Mococo Abyssgard, Gawr Gura]
Day and night (day and night)
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night (night)
He's all alone through the day and night (day and night)
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night (at, at, at night)
Day and night (day and night)
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night (night)
He's all alone, some things will never change (never change)
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night (at, at, at night, night)
At, at, at night (night)
At, at, at night (night)
