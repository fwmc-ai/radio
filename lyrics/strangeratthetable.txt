[Verse 1: Shiori Novella]
No, you don't wanna be by yourself
Girl, who you want around?
I know I'm not that stranger that you're just playing for now
You used to be my Juliet and I was Romeo
Where was you when there's strangers at the table?
Wishing it was you, I'ma tell you that

[Chorus: Shiori Novella]
Oh baby, give me one more chance
To get my shit together
That man next to you, playing with your heart
Now I'm decorating this tree all alone
Under the mistletoe, no
Only thing missing is my Xmas at home

[Refrain: Koseki Bijou]
I know this sound crazy, but you're still my baby
You'll always be my baby (My Xmas at home)
You don't understand me, I can't go, I can't leave
I always had a family
You could pick the phone up
We should be some grown ups
You won't be alone any longer
We'd be so much stronger
Come on, baby Jesus was a baby
Let's do it for the baby, the baby, the baby

[Chorus: Shiori Novella]
Oh baby, give me one more chance
To get my shit together
That man next to you, playing with your heart
Now I'm decorating this tree all alone
Under the mistletoe, no
Only thing missing is my Xmas at home

[Verse: Koseki Bijou]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, I'm just a man, that's all I am
Last Christmas was a warzone, we should call it Wala Cam
At the crib with all the fam
Auntie Cam and all of them
And they act like Mori
They say, "Where's your shawty?"
Uh, I just wish I could be more in the mix
You are the star in the morning I miss
You are my Christmas tree ornament
Looking just like Lena Horne in “The Wiz”
Don't you know I love you, Sadie?
Don't you know I love you, lady?
Talkin' 'bout some, "Don't save me"
That's just how my daddy raised me

[Refrain: Koseki Bijou]
I know this sound crazy
But you're still my baby
You'll always be my baby (Ah, ah, ah)
You don't understand me
I can't go, I can't leave
I always had a family (Ah, ah, ah)
You could pick the phone up
We could be some grown ups
We won't be alone any longer
We'd be so much stronger
Come on, baby Jesus was a baby
Let's do it for the baby, the baby, the baby
