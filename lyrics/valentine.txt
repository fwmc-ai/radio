[Intro: Mococo Abyssgard]
Revenge, revenge, revenge
Match my new clothes
Ball super hard
Fuck is you on?

[Verse 1: Mococo Abyssgard]
I pull up like Top Gear
I pull up like Top Gear
You could drop the top here
You can give me top here
40 on me, not scared (You could drop the top here)
You can give me top here
You could drop the top here
You can give me top here
40 on me, not scared
You could drop the top here
You could give me top here
I could count my guap here
It really don't stop here
Yes I got my glock here
When is it not here? Aye
Rifle like your rushin'
Aim it at your head
More than a concussion
Yeah you dead
Ain't up for discussion
Treat my bitches like my money
I'm gon' keep 'em coming, aye
Treat my bitches like my fans
I'm gon' keep 'em runnin', aye
Feel like Birdman, on the way
Cuz you know I'm stunnin', aye
Feel like Drake or something
Started from the bottom
Keep new magnums on me at all times
Gun and a condom
On the scene, slide
On the scene you flaugin
I feel like I'm Batman
Had to lose Robin
I was still robbing
Still ghetto snobbing
Still at the top, top, top
Still we was mobbing
Real shit, I can't make this up ho
Put your make-up on ho
Cuz you know you not cute
Pull up in that short skirt
Huh, that's a drive-thru
Pull up on his block and let it go just like the drive-thru
And I got them orders
Whipping all that water, plug
Can't pronounce his name but I know he came from 'cross the board, drugs
Take them too much I'm out of order, rugs
Bodies under them we ain't gon' discuss it
Xans in my stomach
Give her pipe like a plumber
She said I'm going dumb
Had to turn up and go dumber
40 on me, it's dumpin'
I'm gon' pop the trunk, up it
Then I smash your pumpkin
I don't give a fuck, fuck him
He ain't talkin' bout nothing
Pull up on him he gettin' changed
Kinda like the subject
Cuz I know me I had to change
Started flossing, started saucin'
Lay off workers everyday cuz I'm a boss
Pull up on him, let it off
I sip codeine every day to heal the cough
On my dick, give me some air bitch, please get off
Fuck with me you gon' get shot, you gon' get caught

[Verse 2: Fuwawa Abyssgard]
We can never dream
(Of taking shots as players)
We could only dream
Of breaking on they mesh
Cooking up, with that work
Serve it everywhere, sold that shit at church
All I know is get the cash, pop a perc
Go crazy every day that's the motto
Live my real life like it's Grand Theft Auto
Don't believe me? Look inside my closet there's a semi-auto
Don't believe me? Look inside my truck there's a fully auto
Pop you like a bottle then I fuck your model
She won't see tomorrow, yeah
Codeine double
I sip that shit when I feel like I'm in trouble
Balling on my ex I need a triple double
Ask me what this 'bout bitch, this is about the hustle
Flexing on this bitch, don't gotta move a muscle
Pills got me in my head though
Got me feeling like I'm dead, dog
4-4 my wood, dog
Shoot a fuck bitch head off
He ain't even on the list, dog
Ooo, ooo, ooo rich though
Sauce on that bitch like
Ooo, ooo, ooo rizz her
Ice on my wrist
I'm so official
Fuck shooting guns, I'll get a missile
When I start bitch, stop
Pull up on the scene
Rollie on me, stopwatch
Pants sagging cuz I tote a big glock
30 on me, I'm gon' let it off
You still got the safety on 
How you a killer?
You know that I don't got my safety on
I pray that they gone when I pull up
Cuz if they there I'm gon' get them gone, gone, gone

[Verse 3: Koseki Bijou]
We could play whack-a-mole
We could play whack-a-opp
We could play shoot-at-cops
We could play with the mops
You don't wanna see us play with the mops
We could play whack-a-opp
We could play shoot-at-cops
We could play with the mops
You don't wanna see us play with the mops
I'ma stay calm, count my commas
But if you want smoke
Then I'm loading up llamas
I'ma stay calm, count my commas
But if you want smoke
Then I'm loading up llamas, yeah
Army on my side bitch
All of us is heroes
We don't really got no sidekick

[Verse 4: Nerissa Ravencroft]
Meditate until my soul evaporate
40 on my hip like who gon' die today?
I just want some peace, want some inner peace
I got outer enemies and inner enemies
Demons in my soul, they won't let go
I don't trust a soul, feel like Metro
Hoes sticking to me like I'm velcro
No Adidas, but this Nina give you shell toes
I was balling on my ex like an N1
Draco on me and I tote it like a handgun
If he talking he get caught up out the random
Fuck that bitch because I'm young, rich, and handsome
They can't fuck with the kid if they wanted
We smoke that bitch like we smoke marijuana
Roll a Backwood up in the backwoods
Got the pack, wood on me, up to no good
Play that bitch like Hendricks
Fuck her to my music, kick her out
Thought I was kidding, hah
They was talking tough until I pull up and tote that Smith in, aye
Fucking that bitch in the back of the passenger, you know I'm going
I pop a Molly and Xanny and Vicodin, you know I'm rolling
Don't give a fuck if police are patrolling
Run him over, hit my smoke
Bitch I got these jokers
I’m gon’ pull his card right like he playing poker
I’m gon’ take his soul right, look like Illuminati
Bitch I got the shotty, I shoot up the party
That bitch off the Molly

R. Kelly with the shits
Bitch I'm pissed off
I'mma beat his face in and he get lockjaw
They gon' try to book a man, look like Matlock
Smoking good weed with some bad cops
Toting good guns and some bad opps
Double cup my troubles away, I'mma do that
Choppa in my Gucci bag, not afraid to shoot that
I be wavy as hell, like a durag
Pull up on his team, he gon' get his whole crew snapped out

[Verse 5: Shiori Novella]

Yes I got a gun card, bitch you can Glock me
Pull up in that new thang, feeling like I'm Bruce Wayne
Swag on these hoes, designin' my clothes
Change my wardrobe like I change hoes

Pull up shooting like a gun range ho
But if you die you ain't coming back this is not a gun game ho
President like sane ho
Pull up on the scene shoot a hole in you, hole in your dome
Pull that bitch and then I kick her out
Aye you kissing her? My dick was in her mouth, ugh

[Outro: FUWAMOCO]
Bitch I won't stop, bitch I won't stop
Getting to the cash, yeah getting to the guap
She ain't worried about my sun sign, sign
She just worried 'bout my moon sign, sign
She asking me about crystals and asks if it's an issue if I carry one at all times
She's asking me about alchemy and asking me if I've been cleansed
And when I ask her why, she say you gon' find out when you sleep at night
It don't get realer than that
I pour the codeine in my cup, mmm
I don't want to hear about him
He's irrelevant and I'm up next
I got everything he wants that's an upset
I can never give a fuck if I care
So no, I don't care yeah, yeah
Bitch I won't stop, bitch I won't stop
Getting to the cash, yeah getting to the guap
