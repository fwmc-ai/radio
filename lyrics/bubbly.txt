[Intro]
Aye we really Moomin' now
You're listening to: FWMC-AI Radio

[Verse 1: Nanashi Mumei]
My career 'bout to blast like bubbly
I'm not waitin' for her to say she love me
I can tell she fuck with me, man, trust me
I got a ten-year-old mink still ain't fuzzy
Three-twenty-five on the dashboard
Ridin' in the Porsche, rockin' Tom Ford
I ball at Barneys, new Christian Dior
I took the jet to the New York store
She lick while I'm drivin', I'm stainin' the floor
I took it off track, now I'm ridin' in sport
You stay in your feelings, you never my boy
I can't come to the hood, I pull a decoy
Another body drop and they screamin' my name
I'm goin' to L.A. on a private plane
Could never come back and my family straight
I'm touchable? No, I'm too rich and too paid
Skeleton Cartier, black diamonds face
Pull up too deep like a fuckin' parade
Old jealous-ass bitches tryna fuck up my pay (Ha)
Blast off, Rolls-Royce Cullinan rain (Cullinan rain)
I put baguettes in my wrist and my neck and my ears and my motherfuckin' chains
This drip out the trenches, I know you gon' dig it, I come through this motherfucker plain (Woah)
I cut up my wrist, soakin' wet (Yeah) and Coachella keep callin', they won't see the face (YAH)
I took her to China and changed up her climate and now she ain't talkin' the same (GURRRA)

[Verse 2: Gawr Gura]
Five nights up, still poppin' and ragin'
The SVR still livin' deranged (Gur-r-ra)
I want her, she wanted the same
Hit 'em both same time, both glad that they came (It's lit)
Keep me a vibe, but can't keep it contained
Know I keep me some dawgs, always keep 'em in training (Gur-r-ra)
Tat' a logo on the back of my brain
Don't ask me what the fuck am I thinkin' (Gur-r-ra)
Back of these walls, I'm full of that drank
Moom came through with a little entertainment (Aye we really Moomin' now // Gur-r-ra)
Area 29, got it lookin' like space
Houston, it's a problem way we bustin' up faces and shit (Gur-r-ra)
I came with the snakes, no squids (Straight up)
I broke out the game with a 456
She lovin' the fest', I see it (Gur-r-ra)
She lovin' the fest'
Yeah, I see it on her face, and I'm lovin' that body
In lace, I know you lovin' Spider and Jack
Yeah, I know you got taste, if you love yourself, take shots with me
If I love you, I'll drop you a pin to a time and a place (Wait)

[Verse 3: FUWAMOCO]
Bau Bau on the track!
H-EN'll put ya dogs six feet
I ain't beggin' when I tell a bitch, "Please"
Me and Moco-chan on fleek
Now that lil' ho wanna meet, ayy
Bau, bau, bau, bau!
Fuck her on beat
Holo life not cheap
I'm a young boy too T'd
Wire just hit my account, never seen that amount, oh God, I'm geeked
Been on the charts for five hundred weeks, so somebody love when I speak
Doin' this shit just to show we get down in the 6, man, it's bigger than me
Texas ranch so big, that shit is perfect for the dippin'
I don't care how wet I get her, she won't catch meâ€”
Three-twenty-five on the dashboard
Ride in the Porsche, rockin' Tom Ford
Rockin' her bed and the headboard
Bau, bau, bau, bau!
Buyin' out Louis and Christian Dior
I took the jet to the New York store
Park at the regular airport
You stay in your feelings, was never my boy

Aye we really Moomin' now
