[Chorus: Ironmouse]
No, I know this ain't no competition (Yeah, yeah)
Tell me 'bout your day, I wanna listen (Yeah)
Hit the jackpot with you (Oh)
Throw these racks out with you (Oh)
Shot my shot and now I know, I hit the score
Bae, I cannot love you more and more and more and more and more, more, more
I love you more and more and more and more and more, more, more

[Verse 1: Ironmouse]
More, plus, plus, plus (Plus)
You don't give a fuck, fuck, fuck
Laid up, bustin' nuts
Listening to "Knuck If You Buck"
You know I ain't even playin' (I ain't even playin')
I'm tellin' you the plan right now (Now)
Tryna get down on one knee, tryna be a man right now
Because

[Bridge: Ironmouse]
Loving you is easy 'cause you're beautiful (Oh)
And everything that you do
Has got me trippin' (Fallin')
Private jet, takin' trips (Ballin')

[Verse 2: Nanashi Mumei]
Fat ass
Sweet thighs (Yeah)
I'ma spread 'em, make 'em do the peace sign
Tasty (Yeah)
I hop in that pussy waist deep
Then hop in the whip and take us a trip
And you can have anything you see
And excess success and whole lot of sex
Tiffany said no blood diamonds, but I cut these fool necks for you
Cop ten more investments for you and send 'em through text
Let me get back in that neck

[Chorus: Mococo Abyssgard]
I know this ain't no competition (Yeah, yeah)

Throw these racks out with you (Woah)
I don't give a fuck about it, let it hit the floor
Baby, I go get you more

[Verse 3: Mococo Abyssgard]
I wanna see the whole world with you
I'm tryna fuck on some girls with you
ADHD when it come to these hoes
Willin' to put in the work with you
My lady cranky and she cute
Keep on slurpin' me like soup
Okay, spinnin' the block
They hot, they hit me, it hurts me to lose (Ah)
I'm grateful, 'preciate ya
My b-b-b-b-aby
My grace and my temptation
My ace is crazy
I just love your fuckin' face
I'm in the streets, before I leave, I hit it just in case
Okay (Okay)

[Chorus: Ironmouse, Nanashi Mumei, Mococo Abyssgard]
I know this ain't no competition (Yeah, yeah)
Tell me 'bout your day, I wanna listen (Yeah)
Hit the jackpot with you (Oh)
Throw these racks out with you (Oh)
Shot my shot and now I know, I hit the score
Bae, I cannot love you more and more and more and more and more, more, more
I love you more and more and more and more and more, more, more
I hit the jackpot with you (Woah)
Throw these racks out with you (Woah)
I don't give a fuck about it, let it hit the floor
Baby, I go get you more and more and more and more and more, more, more
I hit you more and more and more and more and more, more, more
I hit the jackpot with you (Woah)
Throw these racks out with you (Woah)
