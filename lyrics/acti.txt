[act i: stickerz "99"]

[Chorus: Gawr Gura]
I might just call and catch a plane
I might just come see you today
You hate I'm stuck up in my ways
But love it when I'm playin' games
That's the only way we get away
We stuck together, you mines forever
That's why I cannot go away
I'll leave you screamin' anything

[Post-Chorus: Gawr Gura]
You'll find a way to keep me in
Make me think you threw some magic in it (Oh, no)
Act like you did it, mhm, yeah
Don't be trippin', I'll be there in a minute
You itty-bitty, and I'll be there

[Bridge]
Be there

[Chorus: Gawr Gura]
I might just call and catch a plane
I might just come see you today
You hate I'm stuck up in my ways
But love it when I'm playin' games
That's thе only way we get away
We stuck togеther, you mines forever
That's why I cannot go away
I'll leave you screamin' anything

[Post-Chorus: Gawr Gura]
You'll find a way to keep me in
Make me think you threw some magic in it (Oh, no)
Act like you did it, mhm, yeah
Don't be trippin', I'll be there in a minute
You itty-bitty, and I'll be there


[act ii: date @ 8 (remix)]

[Chorus: Gawr Gura]
I'll come and slide by 8 p.m.
And send a text to your DM
Five hundred for your fuckin’ hair
Two hundred for your fuckin' nails
You runnin' out of shoes to wear
So I bought you another pair

[Verse 1: Gawr Gura]
Girl, I got you another dress
So bring your ass up down them stairs
I buy you shit because you rare
And, plus, because you know I care
Bitch, you know you love it here
That’s why you keep on comin' near
That's why you can't compete, I swear (Nah, for real)
He tried, but now he look too weak, baby

[Chorus: Gawr Gura]
I'll come and slide by 8 p.m.
And send a text to your DM
Five hundred for your fuckin' hair
Two hundred for your fuckin' nails
You runnin' out of shoes to wear
So I bought you another pair
You runnin' out of shoes to wear
So I bought you another pair

[Break: Gawr Gura]
I’ll come and slide by 8 p.m.

[Verse 2: FUWAMOCO]
What did I do to deserve you?
Don’t even know what I did
Been prayin' on it since a kid
I guess it’s just luck if you say so
How you get all of that body and face, though?
What kinda water they servin' in Clayco?
This is me talkin', it's not the añejo
Ready to pop out, but we gotta lay low
I really gotta calm down
’Fore I end up in jeopardy just like the game show
Broski my twin, that's my bestie
He love me, said I got the blessin'
I swear he's gassin' me up
There's no way in hell I see you passin' me up
Almost said I loved your ass right after we fucked
Don't know why, girl, it was on the tip of my tongue
Yeah, found someone I'm fallin' for
You hit me back, we're talkin' more now
The bodies that you caught before (They don't)
Make me mad or insecure (I'm good)
A thousand on your fuckin' hair
Two hunnid on your fuckin' nails, for real
This shit feel like a fairy tale (I swear)
I'll make them open up Chanel, ch-ch
I'm a stand-up guy like Dave Chappelle
I was cursed, you 'bout to break the spell, for real
Tell him that you done with him
Girl, who cares if he gon' take it well? You're done

[Outro]
(Five hundred for your fuckin' hair)
(Two hundred for your fuckin' nails)


[act iii: on god? (she like)]

[Chorus: Gawr Gura]
She like, "Boy, go find someone, find someone you love"
Girl, I can't find no one, 'cause you the one I love
You don't understand, it's so hard to trust
She like, "You not the one, you didn't give me enough"
Seen us
Trust me, I seen from far
You told me that you loved me
And you put that shit on God

[Verse: Gawr Gura]
You so damn hard to read
It's so damn hard to please you
I know you're wrong for me
But I still want you to come home to me
It's not my fault, or is it?
Girl, I didn't know
You thought it would make a difference
If you let me go, go, go, oh

[Chorus: Gawr Gura]
She like, "Boy, go find someone, find someone you love"
Girl, I can't find no one, 'cause you the one I love
You don't understand, it's so hard to trust
She like, "You not the one, you didn't give me enough"
Seen us
Trust me, I seen from far
You told me that you loved me
And you put that shit on God

[Outro: Gawr Gura]
Don't you walk away now
Look at what we made together
Don't you walk away now
We can clear this stuff together
Don't you walk away now
Look at what we made together
Don't you walk away now
We can clear this stuff together

[Outro: FUWAMOCO]
I can't make any promises but I'll do my best
Bau bau
