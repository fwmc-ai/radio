[Intro]
Please don't do the most right now
If I hit you up, please don't go ghost right now
Don't do it to me, don't do it to me (To me, to me, to me)
Baby, don't do it to me, do it to me (Yeah)
Please don't do the most right now (Yeah)
If I hit you up, please don't go on ghost right now (I can move on from it)
Don't do it to me, don't do it to me (To me, to me)
Baby, don't do it to me (Don't do it), do it to me

[Chorus]
Please don't do the most right now
If I hit you up, please don't go ghost right now
Don't do it to me, don't do it to me
Baby, don't do it to me, don't do it to me
Please don't do the most right now
If I hit you up, please don't go ghost right now
Don't do it to me, don't do it to me
Baby, don't do it to mе, don't do it to me

[Verse 1]
Slidin', I'm on tour right now
When I hit you up, you always hit ignore right now
And I don't undеrstand why you mad at the boy right now
'Cause I know you wouldn't want me, I was poor right now
Tears on my face, they droppin' and they pour right down
'Cause I know what you really are, he ain't know right now
And I know I'll buy you anything in store right now
Man, our love, yeah, it feels like a chore right now, yeah

[Chorus]
Please don't do the most right now
If I hit you up, please don't go ghost right now
Don't do it to me, don't do it to me
Baby, don't do it to me, don't do it to me
Please don't do the most right now
If I hit you up, please don't go ghost right now
Don't do it to me, don't do it to me
Baby, don't do it to me, don't do it to me

[Verse 2]
I met you on a whole different wave
I ain't know nowadays, we be goin' in space
I ain't know nowadays, you be goin' out late
I ain't know nowadays, your sister was your safe place
Oh, I know nowadays, that I came too strong
Yeah, I know nowadays that I really ain't the one
Yeah, I know nowadays that you don't even like my song
It's your reflection from everything I do, so I'ma call

[Chorus]
Please don't do the most right now
If I hit you up, please don't go ghost right now
Don't do it to me, don't do it to me
Baby, don't do it to me, don't do it to me
Please don't do the most right now
If I hit you up, please don't go ghost right now
Don't do it to me, don't do it to me
Baby, don't do it to me, don't do it to me

[Outro]
Please don't do the most right now
If I hit you up, please don't go ghost right now
Don't do it to me, don't do it to me
Baby, don't do it to me, do it to me
