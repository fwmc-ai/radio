[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, woah
Woah, woah
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
Will you meet me at The London?
If you find time, we can run one
Talk about some things we can't undo
You just send the pin, I can find you
6'1", on the money, 9'2"
You just say the word and I'll run through
Two texts, no reply, that's when I knew
I knew, I knew, yeah, I knew

[Verse 1]
Yeah, circumnavigate the globe as the cash grows
Get a nigga whacked like you get the grass mowed 
I'm talkin' slick when I'm with the Big Slime (Big Slime)
Could hit your bitch, you could never hit mine (Never hit mine)
In my DM, they electric slide
No catfishin', this is not a fish fry
Never switch sides on my dog
Catch a contact, hitch a ride, go to Mars
Everybody sing
How could you come up out your face
And say I ain't the hardest artist you done ever heard?
I left a flock of rappers dead and buried
A verse from me is like eleven birds
Just did the math, that's like two thousand dollars every word
I'm on the verge, I'll beat the charge
I killed some dogs and I walked away from it
Then I observe, just how you curve
Then told the Ruffies that they gotta wait for it
"I knowâ€”I know you in high demand"
I'm ballin' on a pussy bitch like Juwanna Mann
I'm drownin' all inside the pussy like I never swam
Ayy, fuck your IG, I put somethin' on your sonogram
I'm the man, ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
Will you meet me at The London?
If you find time, we can run one
Talk about some things we can't undo
You just send the pin, I can find you
6'1", on the money, 9'2"
You just say the word and I'll run through
Two texts, no reply, that's when I knew
I knew, I knew, yeah, I knew

[Verse 2]
Pimp talk, church talk, I can make a brick walk
Up north, down south, Bankhead to Rachel Walk
Hit it with a little water, stretch it like a vocal cord
STD, I run my ward, fuck a fed and his daughter
I'ma run the compound
I supply the cigarettes and bread
I got a main and she gon' ride
She took a quarter and she fled
I'm in the Lamb', so she gon' ride
I see the pain in shawty's light brown eyes
I'm at The London with some big thots
No fries, she eat steaks with the fish sides
Didn't your mama tell you when something on fire, stop, drop and roll? (Aw yeah)
I've been on the road like a pair of spinners at Stop-N-Go's (Yeah)
I could charge 'em like a Dodge Hemi Demon
Got your broad in the garage eatin' semen
Every time a puppa go back to the ward
They act like they wanna start
And we leave them on the cement

[Outro - Slowed & Reverb]
Will you meet me at The London?
If you find time, we can run one
Talk about some things we can't undo
You just send the pin, I can find you
6'1", on the money, 9'2"
You just say the word and I'll run through
Two texts, no reply, that's when I knew
I knew, I knew, yeah, I knew
Will you meet me at The London?
If you find time, we can run one
Talk about some things we can't undo
You just send the pin, I can find you
6'1", on the money, 9'2"
You just say the word and I'll run through
Two texts, no reply, that's when I knew
I knew, I knew, yeah, I knew
