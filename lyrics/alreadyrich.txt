They said they wan' sign a lil' kid for some cheese
I told 'em it's "Fuck 'em, I'm already rich"
This bitch, she just ask me if I got a Tonka for really, I told her, "I got a X6"

I got this basic-ass beat, finna cook it
Big flawless diamonds, bitch, they sit on my wrist
They said they wan' sign a lil' kid for some cheese
I told 'em it's "Fuck 'em, I'm already rich"

[Post Chorus: Mococo Abyssgard]
I told 'em, "Go turn it up," I got these flawless diamonds on me, bizzy, I'm already up

Fuckin' this bitch from the side, tore that ass up

Hold on, hold on, think I heard you twirp, you spittin' bird's beak

[Chorus: Gawr Gura]
I got this basic-ass beat, finna cook it
Big flawless diamonds, bitch, they sit on my wrist
They said they wan' sign a lil' kid for some cheese

Fuckin' this bitch from the side, tore that ass up

[Outro: Mococo Abyssgard]
I got this basic-ass beat, finna cook it

And I just be callin' up Eliantte for new diamonds, I told 'em to turn on the—
Turn on the, turn on the, turn on the
Turn on the sink
