[Intro: FUWAMOCO]
Bau, bau, bau, bau

[Chorus: FUWAMOCO]
Yeah, I'm rich now, uh
And I might up the switch now
Oh, don't switch now
Ayy, I heard that you switched to a bitch now

[Verse: FUWAMOCO]
Gettin' money, yeah, I'm stackin' up the chips now
Pistol packin', yeah, I keep it on my hip now
Spend a hundred racks just for my motherfuckin' whip now
Pull up on your ass and you get motherfuckin' blicked down
Shawty sent the addy, she my motherfuckin' bitch now
I was flippin' patties, but Young Cracka, he got rich now
Thought you is my homie, but you turned into a bitch now
We gon' hit your dome and we gon' smoke you like some bricks now
Uh, uh, I'm so geeked up
Hit a milli', put my motherfuckin' feet up
And lil' shawty, yeah, she know that I'm a freak, but I am really 'bout it, so don't step to me, don't speak tough
Why you talkin' shit, like, why the fuck you on my meat, bruh?
All the opps get hit, so way nobody wanna meet us
Presidential suites and private passes when they greet us
Leave 'em in the street, I'm goin' fast so they can eat dust

[Chorus: FUWAMOCO]
Yeah, I'm rich now, uh
And I might up the switch now
Oh, don't switch now
Ayy, I heard that you switched to a bitch now
Yeah, I'm rich now, uh
And I might up the switch now
Oh, don't switch now
Ayy, I heard that you switched to a motherfuckin' bitch now

[Verse 2: Koseki Bijou]
When we get done, they gon' play this back
I thought fine shit wanted me, but she wanted Max
I can kick my feet up right now, I can really relax
She gon' fuck the gang for free, we ain't gotta pull out stacks
And my drip be out your league, I just put on black
And I'm really drunk, I can catch the vibe
If she ain't gon' fuck, she can step aside
Max hit the blunt two times, now he hella high
I ain't gon' lie, I peer-pressured him just a little
Every time I wan' message you, I just pull up on you
Anytime you could push up on me, stop sayin' what you gon' do
Why the hell you go in the trunk? Why your firе ain't on you?
Why I let Max done get mе drunk? I don't even drink
Is you really with me? I shouldn't have to think
Snaked out everybody, we like, "What you gained?"
She think she gettin' steakhouse, she gettin' Raising Cane
It's hard for me to fall in love, I'm like Major Payne
I hear sirens, look above, I see nothin' but rain
Florida zaza got me geeked, got me out my brain
She tryna act like she no freak, fine shit actin' lame
Know we slidin' seven deep, better get out the way
I go viral every week, they just like my face
I got blue hundreds on me, I'm at Max place
I'm tapped in with that Twitch, this ain't MySpace
This an Airbnb, this ain't my place
I do shows every week, every Friday

[Chorus: FUWAMOCO]
Yeah, I'm rich now, uh
And I might up the switch now
Oh, don't switch now
Ayy, I heard that you switched to a bitch now
Yeah, I'm rich now, uh
And I might up the switch now
Oh, don't switch now
Ayy, I heard that you switched to a motherfuckin' bitch now
