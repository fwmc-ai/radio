[1.3.7] 2024-12-03

*new song* FUWAMOCO - In FWMC We Trust (FWMC-AI Original Song)

*new song* ironmouse - conceited (lil uzi vert)

*new song* mococo abyssgard - chill bae (lil uzi vert)

*new song* koseki bijou - burning desires (burnice white, zenless zone zero)


[1.3.5] 2024-10-20
ADDED

*new song* gawr gura, ironmouse, mococo abyssgard - zeze (travis scott, kodak black, offset)

*new song* minato aqua - ä¸€é¡†æ–¹ç³–æ‡¸æ»¯çš„æ™‚é–“ [as the sugar cube floats, fleeting in time] (zhu juan, zenless zone zero)

New background using images of all the Hololive Plushies! This was added to give the app a more complete feel to it without the design getting in the way of visibility or performance.

Added a box behind the Total Play Count and Approximate User lines of text to ensure visbility.

ðŸ’¤ emoji tag signifying if a cover comes from the game Zenless Zone Zero.

Regular lyrics for all new songs.

 
CHANGED

Made edits to the splash screen. It now reads "FWMC AI RADIO" instead of just "FWMC RADIO" and I cleaned up the overall design a bit, nothing major just filling in some spots that didn't look great to me, evening out colors and lines.

Updated the App Icon to reflect the new change made to the splash screen logo.

Used the text part of the splash screen graphic and added some bau baus, replaced the header of the website with the png graphic instead of just having plain text for a much nicer looking interface upon opening the site.

Total Play Count now says "Total Play Count: 123,456,789" instead of "123,456,789 plays and counting!"

Instead of artist names and song titles all being one line for each song, I have now changed it to appear as three separate lines: Song Title (Blue), VTubers Covering the Song (Pink), Original Artists that Made the Song (Purple). This is meant to provide more clarity and accessibility when looking for specific songs as the titles would sometimes be so long that you couldn't actually see the song name and had to click on it to get the full name or go based off the cover art. This change resolves that issue and does not effect any functionality when it comes to searching, playlisting, etc. as it uses the data already available to separate into these sections. Play count will still display underneath all of this information and should show up uniformly right above the Add to Playlist button for a clean and simple look.


KNOWN ISSUES

When you search for a song or artist all the songs that appear will show 0 plays until you click on one, then everything will be updated. It is on my to-do list to fix this issue, but it is a very small one that does not effect any functionality of the site itself. Plays are still counted correctly every time a song is played.

TIPS

You can select the "Search" bar and search for nothing. This will allow you to switch around the order of the main page playlist. This was not something I intentionally did, but rather a little trick I found while messing around with the site that may be useful. It's just built into the search functionality itself because if you search for nothing you are searching for everything.


[1.3.4]
ADDED

*new song* bijou koseki, noko shikanoko - hugs, bunnies, cookies, & deer (yung gravy | ai cover)

*new song* gawr gura - shark's gotta bite (ellen joe, zenless zone zero | ai cover)

ðŸ’® emoji tag that signifies if a cover was made by saintlysaint from our Discord.


[1.3.3]
ADDED

Normal lyrics for every song currently on the site/app have been populated.

*new song* kiara takanashi - vanished (crystal castles | ai cover)


[1.3.2]
FIXES
Security update.


[1.3.1]
FIXES
Security update.


[1.3.0]
ADDED

*new song* holomyth - self control (frank ocean, annie dang | ai cover)

*new song* fuwamoco - pink + white (frank ocean, remi wolf | ai cover)

Added an approximate user count underneath the total play count. This approximation is based on number of total DeviceIDs created. It is an approximation because one person can have more than one DeviceID if they log on from different devices. One person can also have no DeviceIDs if they have never made a playlist so the number of users may be higher or lower than what is displayed here.

Show Lyrics Modal - There is now a Show Lyrics Button on the media player modal. When you press the button a Lyrics Modal will pop up and you will either see the synced lyrics to a song (if available these will show up), the lyrics to a song (if synced aren't available but regular are), or you will get a message saying that the lyrics aren't yet available for that song.

Synced Lyrics - pink + white, airplane pt. 2

Regular Lyrics - self control, need a favor, save me, bubbly, bau to the bone


CHANGED

Play Count on individual songs now has an animation that allows all song plays to update in real time like the Universal Play Count Ticker at the top of the page does.


FIXED

Made some edits to the track "bubbly", cleaned up some parts and switched out some lyrics for FWMC's verse.


PLANNED

Adding more lyrics and synced lyrics.

Custom background - Either user chosen or switches to the cover art of the currently playing song like the background of hte Lyric Modal.


[1.2.91]
ADDED

*new song* mori calliope - need a favor (jelly roll, brenna bone | ai cover)

*new song* takanashi kiara - save me (jelly roll, kearstin clark | ai cover)


[1.2.9] - 2024-09-28
FIXED

Test version reiterating version 1.2.8. Fixed issue with site/app not updating to new version. This time when updating to new version DeviceID and playlists remained in tact.


[1.2.8] - 2024-09-28
FIXED

Forced update to refresh app data and clear cache.


[1.2.7] - 2024-09-28
ADDED

Copy Device ID button in Sync Options to easily copy your device ID to your clipboard so you can paste it in your notes. 

Media player now includes a skip 10 ahead and skip 10 back button as well as a repeat button that can be toggled to keep a song on repeat.

*new song* fuwamoco, koseki bijou - dear mama puppy (2pac | ai cover)

*new song* takanashi kiara - airplane pt. 2 (bts, shimmeringrain | ai cover | fwmc-ai x leo_frixi collab)

*new song* gawr gura - dirt (bones | ai cover)

*new song* fuwamoco - bau to the bone // feeling good (george thorogood, nina simone, gab lobo | ai cover + mashup)

*new song* dokibird - die for the party (lecrae | ai cover | leo_frixi)

*new song* nanashi mumei, gawr gura, fuwamoco - (young thug, travis scott, drake | ai cover)


CHANGED

Udated the instructional message in Sync Options to be more informative.

Improved shuffle function to be a more true shuffle. Using the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm.


FIXED

Fetch Playlists button is now operating correctly. If you have the app pulled up on two different devices but have already synced Device IDs then it will keep your set Device ID and if you make changes on one device you can use Fetch Playlists/Refresh Playlists to reflect the changes you made on the other device. This should automatically happen if you don't have the app open in two places at once.

Fixed an issue with synced playlists having trouble with reordering.

Emojis were displaying in place of the arrows buttons for reorganizing playlists. Replaced with a more standard arrow shape.


[1.2.6] - 2024-09-26
ADDED

*new song* -- mococo abyssgard - anacondas (juice wrld) | ai cover | fwmc-ai // leo_frixi collab)

*new song* -- watson amelia - today (smashing pumpkins, first to eleven) | ai cover)

*new song* -- fuwawa abyssgard - last night (morgan wallen, carah | ai cover)

*new song* -- nanashi mumei, gawr gura, ironmouse, filian - beam (rich brian, playboi carti | ai cover) 

Sync Options for playlists. This is a backup method that allows you to save your current device ID and retrieve playlists if your device ever switches to a new device ID. It also allows you to sync playlists between different devices or share playlists with other people. Just remember if you do share a playlist and the person you shared it with edits the playlist, it will reflect for both of you. 

NEW symbol indicating if a song is a new release since the last version of the app.

TURTLE symbol indicating if a song is a collaboration with Leo_Frixi, voice model creator for FWMC-AI. Sometimes Leo starts demo tracks and I polish them up and do the engineering instead of doing the whole song from scratch so this symbol let's you know if a song is one of those tracks. It is also stated in the title of the actual song.


CHANGED

Enhanced the functions that retrive deviceID and store locally so that deviceID remains more consistent throughout updates. This function is a little hard to test until the update is fully pushed and I receive feedback on it, which is why I wanted to make sure to introduce the Sync Options as soon as possible. This way you always have access to playlists you create from now on no matter what changes are made to the app.

Removed the "Apology" part of "7 Minute Drill" -- will include that part in the YouTube reupload, but for the sake of streaming it made more sense (and it was requested) to only include the actual song on the app.

Changed "Play" and "Pause" button to ensure they don't show up as emojis.


FIXES

Once again attempting to fix the search bar button bug on android devices. I think this update should do the trick for that, but will be able to check more thoroughly once this update is pushed.


[1.2.5] - 2024-09-23
ADDED

*new song* -- watson amelia - wake me up when september ends (green day, vivoree | ai cover)

*new song* -- fuwamoco - agora hills (doja cat | ai cover)

*new song* -- nanashi mumei - all red (playboi carti | ai cover)   

Universal total play count ticker at top of screen. This counts and updates the total plays across the site in real time.

"Go to Playlist" button below "Play Playlist" button in case you want to visit your custom playlist screen without playing it right away.

"Refresh Playlist" button has been added as a failsafe in case you see your playlist set back to 0 songs. This will manually fetch the data from Firebase and populate your playlist based on the last saved version.

Patreon link in the Donate & Socials modal. Also a message at the bottom of this modal letting users know what their donations are being used towards.


CHANGED

Changed the "Add to Playlist" button to a "Remove" button when viewing custom playlists.

Updated "Demon Dogs" to not include "The Holo" preview at the end.

Donate link has been changed from Ko-Fi to CashApp -- I may change this back but I am having some issues with Ko-Fi that I have to resolve before using their site.

Splash Screen is now based on session data. If you completely close out the app or completely close out the website, when opening it again you should see the Splash Screen. This works better when using the App version compared to the site version due to browser caching.

If you do have the app downloaded, the text that usually says "Enter Site" will now say "Enter App"


FIXES

Specific optimizations put in place for Android, Samsung, and added optimizations for iOS devices. These optimizations account for more specific details of how each brand's device runs so this includes visual UI optimizations, audio playback optimizations, and general stability optimizations.

Optimization for search bar button sizing on different devices.

Recoded playlist organization function to update in real time, specifically when deleting songs from playlists through the View Playlists Menu or when inside a custom playlist and using the new "Remove From Playlist" button.

Fixed issue where shuffling would cause the "Show Playlist" to say you are listening to the song that took the original one's place. Now it will automatically update the current song's positioning within "Show Playlist" which also enhances the "Next" and "Previous" song features to be in accordance with the current song's positioning.

Various other fixes for things regarding playlists, playlist reorganization, the playlist sidebar, the search songs function, and so on. 

Fixed the "Add to Homescreen" button to actually use the native installer on your browser and android devices. This cannot be implemented for iOS devices, they will always show the message telling you how to add the app to your homescreen because iOS does not allow access to the native installer through a PWA.

Optimized file sizes for cover art to help with loading times when site or app is first initialized.


KNOWN ISSUES

Splash screen reappears every time you refresh a page for desktop. Ideally I would like to fix this to where the page only shows the splash screen when you have completely closed out the website and then reopen it. This works perfectly using the app version of the site when added to homescreen, the splash screen only appears if you completely quit the app and reopen it. If it is open in the background when you bring the app forward it will not reinitiate the splash screen. This is how I would like for things to work on desktop as well.



[1.2.4] - 2024-09-19
This update is only meant to test cache busting and version check features.


[1.2.3] - 2024-09-19
ADDED

Made the header "FWMC-AI Radio" a clickable element that will always take you back to the main view. This button will also unshuffle the main playlist if it is shuffled.

Marquee text for songs names that are longer than can be seen in the media player, text will now scroll back and forth so you can see the entire song name.

Ability to edit playlist name from within the View Playlists screen.


CHANGED

Changed splash screen button to only say "Enter Site" and centered and revised the button altogether. Ensured that the splash screen graphic does not jump when pressing "Enter Site" and "Enter Site" button fades out after being pressed.

Green check animation/indication that a song has successfully been added to a playlist instead of a pop up message.

Small pop up message in corner of screen indicating if a song has already been added to a playlist if you are trying to add the same song to the same playlist twice.


FIXES

Fixed issue where Create New Playlist would successfully create a playlist but not display it. Also optimized playlisting in general making sure that adding to different playlists and having multiple playlists at once would not cause any problems. 

Double checked that reorganizing playlists is working correctly no matter the manner you choose to do so. 

Verified that data is being sent and saved to Firebase with a unique deviceID so that users will not lose their playlists between updates. Will need to get feedback from users to verify that playlists are being saved correctly.

More fixes to cache busting and version check.


[1.2.2] - 2024-09-17
FIXES

Minor fix concerning View Playlist Menu not displaying correctly on some mobile devices.


[1.2.1] - 2024-09-17
ADDED

Splash Screen - Upon first visit, users will encounter a splash screen displaying the FWMC Radio Logo image and an Enter Site button. Audio is played upon pressing the button and the webpage is loaded.

Add to Home Screen Functionality - Ability to use native installer to download the PWA straight to your device. Fallback message enabled if native installer cannot be used instructor user on how they can download the app.

Version Check - Took care of aggressive cache and added a version check to ensure that every user is being directed to the correct version of the application.

Playlists - Ability to create custom playlists. Multiple ways to reorganize playlists. The ability to delete playlists or specific songs on playlists.

Playlists Storage via Firebase - Playlists will be stored so that as new versions of the application are released playlists should not get deleted. Playlists are unique to the device you listen on. Playlists made on your mobile device will not show up on your computer as it is specific to device-id.

Donate and Socials Button - There is now a Donate and Socials Button that includes a Ko-Fi page, Discord Invite, YouTube Channel, and TikTok.


CHANGED

Media Player has been given a Hide/Show Button.

Entire site has been reoptimized for Desktop, Android, and iOS specifically.

Show Full Playlist - Now has a Close button at the top that follows you down the page so you always have the abilty to close any playlist you are in.

Universal Play Count via Firebase - Play Count has been changed to count plays universally no matter what device you listen from. Play counts are a representation of everyone who has accessed the app and played that song, not just your local plays like it was before.

Ability to hit enter or return in order to finish a search function rather than having to press the search button.


FIXED

Issue with Search Songs... that caused the searched song to play the first song from the Main Playlist page. Search Songs should now function properly.

Issue with Shuffle + Show Full Playlist button not showing the shuffled order of the songs. This combination should now give the desired output of the songs being listed in their shuffled order if shuffle is turned on.

Enhanced Background Play - Background play has been reoptimized for more devices.

General bug fixes and UI improvements to better serve a variety of devices.
